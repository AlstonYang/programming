    "1. **Series (1-dimensional)** and \n",
    "2. **DataFrame (2-dimensional)**\n",
    "\n",
    "For R users, DataFrame provides everything that **Râ€™s data.frame** provides and much more. **pandas is built on top of NumPy and** is intended to integrate well within a scientific computing environment with **many other 3rd party libraries**.\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas does well:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Easy handling of **missing data** (represented as **NaN**) in floating point as well as non-floating point data\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Size mutability**: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher dimensional objects\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Automatic and explicit data alignment**: objects can be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and let Series, DataFrame, etc. automatically align the data for you in computations\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform **split-apply-combine operations** on data sets, **for both aggregating and transforming data**\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Make it **easy to convert ragged, differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects**\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Intelligent label-based **slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting** of large data sets\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Intuitive **merging and joining data sets**\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Flexible **reshaping and pivoting of data sets**\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Hierarchical labeling of axes** (possible to have multiple labels per tick)\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Robust IO tools** for loading data from:\n",
    "    1. **flat files (CSV and delimited), Excel files, databases**, and \n",
    "    2. saving / loading data from the ultrafast **HDF5 format**\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Time series**-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, date shifting and lagging.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Multiple stages **for data scientists:**\n",
    "    1. **munging and cleaning data**, \n",
    "    2. **analyzing / modeling** it, then \n",
    "    3. **organizing the results** of the analysis into a form suitable for plotting or tabular display. \n",
    "    4. pandas is the ideal tool for all of these tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other notes\n",
    "\n",
    "**pandas is fast.** Many of the low-level algorithmic bits have been extensively tweaked in **[Cython](https://cython.org/)** code. However, as with anything else generalization usually sacrifices performance. So if you focus on one feature for your application you may be able to create a faster specialized tool.\n",

In general we like to **favor immutability** where sensible."
