      "body:['The past few decades have been filled with a deep optimism about the role of cities and suburbs across the world. These engines of economic growth host a majority of world population, are major drivers of economic innovation, and have created pathways to opportunities for untold amounts of people.\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJeffrey Gutman\\nNonresident Senior Fellow - Global Economy and Development\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdie Tomer\\nFellow - Metropolitan Policy Program\\n\\n Twitter\\nAdieTomer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'But all is not well within our so-called Urban Century. Rapid urbanization, rising gentrification, concentrated poverty, and shortages of basic infrastructure have combined to create spatial inequity in cities and suburbs across the globe. The challenges of housing, moving, and employing so many people have led to longer travel times, rising housing costs, and unsustainable public spending. Moreover, policymakers are questioning traditional policies and approaches.', 'The past couple years, we’ve led a project at Brookings—Moving to Access—that responds to these spatial challenges by promoting the idea of connecting people to opportunities as a new foundational principle for 21st century urban development. This principle of accessibility is meant to be a corollary to the natural questions we ask ourselves everyday about the communities where we live: Is this the best location to access employment? Are there nearby schools and health services? Is there a market in the neighborhood? How can I get from here to there? Such choices are valid for those with sufficient income. But what about those with more limited resources and thus choices in terms of affordable housing and affordable transport?', 'While economists, planners, and engineers have promoted accessibility for decades, the concept is more often found in textbooks than formal urban policies. In the first stage of this project, we worked with a team of experts to determine what has stalled practical implementation of appropriate policies and practices? “Delivering Inclusive Access,” a report of this initial work, offers a synthesis of what we found and where we believe researchers, policymakers, and practitioners can take this work next. The paper found three central challenges.', 'The current transport regime’s approach to measurement is one of outward elegance: The dominant pursuit is speed, and the primary way to measure it is congestion (or what slows us down). Many have come to label this approach a pursuit of “mobility.” It is seen through different, but often singular, measures of how congestion affects a specific roadway. Such singular measures are easily interpreted by policymakers and civil society and can be translated directly into economic analysis of related investments through timesavings. They also conveniently serve such purposes as the internationally agreed-upon Sustainable Development Goals. Yet they actually don’t answer the fundamental question of who can reach where, in how much time, and at what cost.\\n\\n\\nRelated Content\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nReport\\nDelivering inclusive access\\n\\nJeffrey Gutman, Adie Tomer, Joseph W.

First, the variable social, economic, and political contexts related to access mean searching for a single magical indicator is counterintuitive. For example, a wealthy, automobile-centric region like Dallas, Texas, may have very different measurable goals than a denser, poorer region like Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Second, academic literature is now rife with such complex measures that it could be difficult to communicate their methodology and results with practitioners. The development of a suite of indicators could offer a menu for policymakers and practitioners to judge accessibility based on local objectives, local conditions, and local capacity.', '', 'Decentralization and empowering local communities is fast becoming a mantra of governance experts across the world, from development practitioners at institutions like the World Bank to city-focused theorists. And for good reason: delegating policy design and fiscal authority directly to the local level helps ensure policies and practices respond to local needs and desires. Yet as urban areas spillover into contiguous and often numerous municipalities, local independence can introduce certain challenges, especially relating to social and environmental externalities. When it comes to transportation and land development, interests of one municipality are often different from its neighbors. And these divergent development goals can exacerbate accessibility challenges within growing regions, spreading people, housing jobs, and other activities further from one another.', 'Addressing spatial inequities in land use and real estate markets require a broader approach to horizontal governance. While there are examples of metropolitan transport authorities, there is less willingness to consider metropolitan or horizontal governance of land use and fiscal policies. For example, should housing be coordinated across an entire region?', 'Countries with a more centralized top down approach to governance, such as France and Germany, have greater ability to formulate metropolitan governance than more decentralized countries such as the U.S. This is not to say there is a one-size-fits-all approach, but there is an opportunity to test different solutions within different governance contexts, comparing how effective each model is to promote spatial inclusivity.', 'Financing is a central topic in infrastructure circles. As maintenance bills from the automobile era come due, populations continue to grow, and fiscal budgets are tight, how can urban areas afford to build enough infrastructure to support future economic growth? In response, new approaches are evolving in fiscal instruments, such as value capture and private-public partnerships. Missing in these discussions, however, are the implications for inclusive access.', 'We conducted a multi-decade review of past academic literature on access and found that there is no clear substantive discussion of accessibility from a fiscal perspective. While urban transport and land use professionals clearly recognize their interrelationship in achieving inclusive accessibility, at least in theory, the fiscal and finance professionals generally ignore the implications of their instruments with regard to inclusivity. The multilateral development banks and their economic evaluations have ignored the distributive impacts until very recently. And the efforts of some countries to incorporate measures through multi-criteria analysis have had limited impact.', 'This gap must be resolved in any effort toward inclusive urban development. There is little doubt that fiscal approaches must carefully assess who ultimately pays and that alternative finance instruments should be adapted to foster access for all.', 'Our research confirms that there are enormous opportunities to advance accessibility theory into practice. At this point, what is desperately needed is to launch a range of case studies that deal with these issues and challenges under different geographic, governance, and economic contexts. The good news is that many initiatives are already underway, and more robust communication channels and technology can support such efforts. In Chicago, researchers created an online platform to visually explore accessibility by location.\\xa0In Bogota,\\xa0researchers evaluated how affordability is a key principle of access. And in Cairo and Kigali,\\xa0researchers used open tools to achieve new insights for accessibility. Sharing the results of these case studies could lead to a new level of cross-disciplinary approaches to improve accessibility and lessen the effects of spatial inequity.']\n",

      "title: The Men Who Want to Live Forever\n",
      "body: Would you like to live forever? Some billionaires, already invincible in every other way, have decided that they also deserve not to die. Today several biotech companies, fueled by Silicon Valley fortunes, are devoted to “life extension” — or as some put it, to solving “the problem of death.”\n",
      "It’s a cause championed by the tech billionaire Peter Thiel, the TED Talk darling Aubrey de Gray, Google’s billion-dollar Calico longevity lab and investment by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos. The National Academy of Medicine, an independent group, recently dedicated funding to “end aging forever.”\n",
      "As the longevity entrepreneur Arram Sabeti told The New Yorker: “The proposition that we can live forever is obvious. It doesn’t violate the laws of physics, so we can achieve it.” Of all the slightly creepy aspects to this trend, the strangest is the least noticed: The people publicly championing life extension are mainly men.\n",
      "Not all of them, of course. In 2009, Elizabeth Blackburn received the Nobel Prize for her work on telomeres, protein caps on chromosomes that may be a key to understanding aging. Cynthia Kenyon, the vice president for aging research at Calico, studied life extension long before it was cool; her former protégée, Laura Deming, now runs a venture capital fund for the cause. But these women are focused on curbing age-related pathology, a concept about as controversial as cancer research. They do not appear thirsty for the Fountain of Youth.\n",
      "Professor Blackburn’s new book on telomeres couldn’t be clearer. “Does our research show that by maintaining your telomeres you will live into your hundreds?” it says. “No. Everyone’s cells become old and eventually we die.” Ms. Kenyon once described her research’s goal as “to just have a healthy life and then turn out the lights.” Even Ms. Deming, a 23-year-old prodigy who worked in Ms. Kenyon’s lab at age 12, points out that “aging is innately important to us.”\n",
      "Few of these experts come close to matching the gaudy statements of the longevity investor and “biohacker” Dave Asprey, who has told journalists, “I decided that I was just not going to die.” Or those of Brian Hanley, a microbiologist who has tested an anti-aging gene therapy he developed on himself, who claimed: “There’s a bunch of things that will need to be done to achieve life spans into at least hundreds of years. But we’ll get there.” Or of the 74-year-old fashion mogul Peter Nygard, who during a promotional clip receives injections of his own stem cells to reverse his aging while declaring: “Ponce de León had the right idea. He was just too early. That was then. This is now.”\n",
      "I came across Mr. Nygard’s ode to human endurance three years ago while beginning research on a novel about a woman who can’t die, and watching that video allowed me to experience something close to life extension. As Mr. Nygard compared himself to Leonardo da Vinci and Benjamin Franklin while dancing with a bevy of models — or as a voice-over explained, “living a life most can only dream of” — nine minutes of YouTube expanded into a vapid eternity, where time melted into a vortex of solipsism.\n",
      "At that time I was immersed in caring for my four young children, and this paean to everlasting youth seemed especially stupid. I recall thinking that if this was eternal life, death didn’t seem that bad.\n",
      "But now, as powerful men have begun falling like dominoes under accusations of sexual assault, that video with its young women clustered around an elderly multimillionaire has haunted me anew. As I recall my discomfort with the proclamations of longevity-driven men who hope to achieve “escape velocity,” I think of the astonishing hubris of the Harvey Weinsteins of the world, those who saw young women’s bodies as theirs for the taking.\n",
      "Much has been said about why we allowed such behavior to go unchecked. What has remained unsaid, because it is so obvious, is what would make someone so shameless in the first place: These people believed they were invincible. They saw their own bodies as entirely theirs and other people’s bodies as at their disposal; apparently nothing in their lives led them to believe otherwise.\n",
      "Historically, this is a mistake that few women would make, because until very recently, the physical experience of being a woman entailed exactly the opposite — and not only because women have to hold their keys in self-defense while walking through parking lots at night. It’s only very recently that women have widely participated in public life, but it’s even more recently that men have been welcome, or even expected, to provide physical care for vulnerable people.\n",
      "Only for a nanosecond of human history have men even slightly shared what was once exclusively a woman’s burden: the relentless daily labor of caring for another person’s body, the life-preserving work of cleaning feces and vomit, the constant cycle of cooking and feeding and blanketing and bathing, whether for the young, the ill or the old. For nearly as long as there have been humans, being a female human has meant a daily nonoptional immersion in the fragility of human life and the endless effort required to sustain it.\n",
      "Obviously not everyone who provides care for others is a saint. But engaging in that daily devotion, or even living with its expectation, has enormous potential to change a person. It forces one to constantly imagine the world from someone else’s point of view: Is he hungry? Maybe she’s tired. Is his back hurting him? What is she trying to say?\n",
      "The most obvious cure for today’s gender inequities is to put more women in power. But if we really hope to create an equal society, we will also need more men to care for the powerless — more women in the boardroom, but also more men at the nurses’ station and the changing table, immersed in daily physical empathy. If that sounds like an evolutionary impossibility, well, it doesn’t violate the laws of physics, so we can achieve it. It is surely worth at least as much investment as defeating death.\n",
      "Perhaps it takes the promise of immortality to inspire the self-absorbed to invest in unsexy work like Alzheimer’s research. If so, we may all one day bless the inane death-defiance as a means to a worthy end.\n",
      "But men who hope to live forever might pause on their eternal journey to consider the frightening void at invincibility’s core. Death is the ultimate vulnerability. It is the moment when all of us must confront exactly what so many women have known all too well: You are a body, only a body, and nothing more.\n"

      "TITLE:EPA chief wants scientists to debate climate on TV\n",
      "BODY:\n",
      "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is in the early stages of launching a debate about climate change that could air on television – challenging scientists to prove the widespread view that global warming is a serious threat, the head of the agency said. \n",
      "The move comes as the administration of President Donald Trump seeks to roll back a slew of Obama-era regulations limiting carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels, and begins a withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement - a global pact to stem planetary warming through emissions cuts. \n",
      "“There are lots of questions that have not been asked and answered (about climate change),” EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt told Reuters in an interview late on Monday.  \n",
      "“Who better to do that than a group of scientists... getting together and having a robust discussion for all the world to see,” he added without explaining how the scientists would be chosen. \n",
      "Asked if he thought the debate should be televised, Pruitt said: “I think so. I think so. I mean, I don’t know yet, but you want this to be open to the world. You want this to be on full display. I think the American people would be very interested in consuming that. I think they deserve it.” \n",
      "Pruitt, one of the most controversial figures in the Trump administration, has repeatedly expressed doubts about climate change – one of the main points of contention in his narrow confirmation by the Senate.  \n",
      "While acknowledging the planet is warming, Pruitt says he questions the gravity of the problem and the need for regulations that require companies to take costly measures to reduce their carbon footprint. \n",
      "“It is a question about how much we contribute to it. How do we measure that with precision? And by the way, are we on an unsustainable path? And is it causing an existential threat?” he said in the interview. \n",
      "Since taking up his role at EPA, he has emerged as one of the more prolific Trump cabinet appointees, taking steps to undo more than two dozen regulations, and influencing Trump’s decision to pull the United States from the Paris climate change deal, agreed by nearly 200 countries in 2015. \n",
      "Pruitt rejected global criticism of the United States for pulling out of the climate deal, which Trump has said would have cost America trillions of dollars without benefit. \n",
      "“We have nothing to be apologetic about,” Pruitt said. “It was absolutely a decision of courage and fortitude and truly represented an America First strategy with respect to how we are leading on this issue.” \n",
      "Pruitt said the United States had already cut its carbon output to the lowest levels in nearly 25 years without mandates, thanks mainly to increased use of natural gas - which burns cleaner than coal. \n",
      "Pruitt said his desire for the agency to host an ongoing climate change debate was inspired by two articles published in April – one in the Wall Street Journal by theoretical physicist Steve Koonin, who served as undersecretary of energy under Obama – and one by conservative columnist Brett Stephens in the New York Times.  \n",
      "Koonin’s article made the case that climate science should use the “red team-blue team” methodology used by the national security community to test assumptions. Stephens’ article criticized claims of complete certainty in climate science, saying that it “traduces the spirit of science.” \n",
      "Pruitt said scientists should not scoff at the idea of participating in these debates. \n",
      "“If you’re going to win and if you’re so certain about it, come and do your deal. They shouldn’t be scared of the debate and discussion,” he said. \n",
      "Pruitt said debate is not necessarily aimed at undermining the 2009 “endangerment finding,” the scientific determination that carbon dioxide harms human health that formed the basis for the Democratic Obama administration’s regulation of greenhouse gases. He said there may be a legal basis to challenge the finding but would prefer Congress weigh in on the matter. \n",
      "In the interview, Pruitt added that he intended to deal “very aggressively” with automakers that use devices to cheat emissions tests, and would also seek to boost accountability for companies to clean up polluted sites under the Superfund program.  \n",
      "He said EPA was also not ready to decide yet on a change proposed by Trump’s special adviser Carl Icahn to the U.S. biofuels program, that would shift the burden of blending biofuels like ethanol into gasoline away from refiners to companies further down the supply chain. \n",

      "Idea to Retire: Old methods of policy education\n",
      "BODY:\n",
      "Public policy and public affairs schools aim to train competent creators and implementers of government policy. While drawing on the principles that gird our economic and political systems to provide a well-rounded education, like law schools and business schools, policy schools provide professional training. They are quite distinct from graduate programs in political science or economics which aim to train the next generation of academics. As professional training programs, they add value by imparting both the skills which are relevant to current employers, and skills which we know will be relevant as organizations and societies evolve. \n",
      "The relevance of the skills that policy programs impart to address problems of today and tomorrow bears further discussion. We are living through an era in which societies are increasingly interconnected. The wide-scale adoption of devices such as the smartphone is having a profound impact on our culture, communities, and economy. The use of social and digital media and associated means of communication enabled by mobile devices is changing the tone, content, and geographic scope of our conversations, modifying how information is generated and consumed, and changing the very nature of citizen engagement. \n",
      "Information technology-based platforms provisioned by private providers such as Facebook, Google, Uber, and Lyft maintain information about millions of citizens and enable services such as transportation that were mediated in the past solely by the public sector. Surveillance for purposes of public safety via large-scale deployment of sensors also raises fundamental questions about information privacy. From technology-enabled global delivery of work to displacement and replacement of categories of work, some studies estimate that up to 47 percent of U.S. employment might be at risk of computerization with an attendant rise in income inequality. These technology-induced changes will affect every policy domain. How should policy programs best prepare students to address societal challenges in this world that is being transformed by technology? We believe the answer lies in educating students to be “men and women of intelligent action.” \n",
      "We begin with a skills-based model of policy education. These four essential skills address the general problems policy practitioners frequently face:\n",
      "These skills make up the policy analysis toolkit required to be data driven practitioner of “intelligent action” in any policy domain. This toolkit needs to be supplemented by an understanding of how technology is transforming societal challenges, enabling new solutions, or disrupting existing regulatory regimes. This understanding is essential to policy formulation and implementation. \n",
      "As with engineering, where design precedes analysis, this first pillar seeks to educate students in thinking creatively about problems in order to devise and develop policy ideas. Using ideas derived from design, divergent and convergent thinking principles are employed to generate, explore, and arrive at a candidate set of solutions. Using Uber as an example, an approach to identify and explore the key policy issues such as convenience, costs, driver working hours, and insurance would involve interviewing and observing both incumbent taxi drivers and Uber drivers. This in turn would lead to a set of alternatives that deserve further and careful consideration.  Using these skills, candidate designs and choices that are generated can be evaluated using the policy analytic toolkit. \n",
      "\n",
      "At Carnegie Mellon, we are often cited in media and interrogated by peers on our approach to analytical and technology skills education. Curiosity about which skills are the “right” skills to teach policy practitioners are common, but we believe this is the wrong approach. We instead begin from the premise that policy or management decisions should be grounded in evidence.  We then determine the skills required to assemble the types of evidence that will likely be available to policy makers in the future.  In increasingly instrumented environments where citizens and infrastructure produce continuous streams of data, making sense of it all will require a somewhat different set of skills. We believe that a grounding in micro-economics, operations research, statistics, and program evaluation (aka causal inference) to be an essential core to policy programs. \n",
      "New coursework will teach students to work with multi-variable data and machine learning with an emphasis on prediction. This material ought to be part of the required coursework in statistics given the importance of prediction in many policy implementation settings. Along the same lines, the ability to work with unstructured data (especially text) and data visualization will become increasingly relevant to all students, not just those students who want to specialize in data analytics. Finally, knowledge of data manipulation and analysis languages such as Python and R for analytic work will be important because data often has to be massaged and cleansed prior to analysis. An important task for programs will be to determine the competencies expected of graduates. \n",
      "The third pillar of the skills-based model is interpersonal experience, where the practiced habits of good communication and steady negotiation developed with a sound understanding of organizations, their design and their behaviors. We label these purposely as experiences rather than skills because we believe they are best practiced either in the real-world or in simulated real-world settings. It is also in this pillar where practitioners learn the knowledge necessary to become credible experts in their domain. We believe that in addition to core coursework in the area, a supplementary curriculum which provides students with opportunities to gain these experiences is an essential component of our educational model.\n",

      "The ability to carefully diagnose the effectiveness of policy or management interventions is the fourth pillar of our model. It is insufficient to create and execute policy without measurement, and this is where both careful thought to the fundamental issues of measurement and evaluation become important. The ability to make objective judgments on the benefits, liabilities, and unintended consequences of prior policies is the goal of this set of skills. Here, sound statistical and econometric training with an understanding of the principles of causal inference is essential. In addition, program evaluation skills such as cost-benefit and financial analysis help practitioners round out their evaluation skills by considering both non-monetary and economic impacts.\n",
      "A skills-based approach might replace certain aspects of existing policy training.  This depends on a number of factors specific to each institution, but three generally applicable observations are clear. First, real-world experiences are a powerful way to encode domain learning as well as project management skills. Through project-based work, students can learn about institutional contexts in specific policy domains and political processes such as budgeting. Second, team-based projects allow students to learn and apply principles of management and organizational behavior. At Carnegie Mellon, we refer to these as “systems synthesis” projects, since they require students to adopt a systemic point of view and to synthesize a number of skills in their policy analysis toolkit. Third, interpersonal skills training can be practiced through activities such as weekend negotiation exercises, hackathons, and speaker series. These activities can be highly intentional and fashioned to reinforce skills rather than as a recess from the “real work” of classroom training. Since students complete graduate programs in such a short time, counseling them to focus on outcomes from day one will allow them to choose a reinforcing set of coursework and real-world experiences. \n",
      "In summary, we argue for a model of policy education that views practitioners as future problem solvers. Good policy education must consider the ways in which problems will present themselves, and the ways in which answers will obscure themselves. Rigorous training grounded in the analysis of available evidence and buoyed by real-world interpersonal experiences is a sound approach to relevant, durable policy training.\n",

      "TITLE:Oil Boom Gives the U.S. a New Edge in Energy and Diplomacy\n",
      "BODY:\n",
      "HOUSTON — A substantial rise in oil prices in recent months has led to a resurgence in American oil production, enabling the country to challenge the dominance of Saudi Arabia and dampen price pressures at the pump.\n",
      "The success has come in the face of efforts by Saudi Arabia and its oil allies to undercut the shale drilling spree in the United States. Those strategies backfired and ultimately ended up benefiting the oil industry.\n",
      "Overcoming three years of slumping prices proved the resiliency of the shale boom. Energy companies and their financial backers were able to weather market turmoil — and the maneuvers of the global oil cartel — by adjusting exploration and extraction techniques.\n",
      "After a painful shakeout in the industry that included scores of bankruptcies and a significant loss of jobs, a steadier shale-drilling industry is arising, anchored by better-financed companies.\n",
      "With the price of West Texas intermediate crude above $65 a barrel, a level not seen in almost three years, the United States is becoming a dominant producer. It is able to outflank competitors in supplying growing global markets, particularly China and India, while slashing imports from the Middle East and North Africa.\n",
      "This year, the United States is expected to surpass Saudi Arabia and to rival Russia as the world’s leader, with record output of over 10 million barrels a day, according to the International Energy Agency.\n",
      "“This is a 180-degree turn for the United States and the impacts are being felt around the world,” said Daniel Yergin, the economic historian and author of “The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power.” “This not only contributes to U.S. energy security but also contributes to world energy security by bringing new supplies to the world.”\n",
      "At the same time, the United States is becoming a major exporter of natural gas, another outgrowth of the shale revolution, undercutting Russian energy dominance over Eastern Europe.\n",
      "The improving energy picture comes as the Trump administration is attempting to increase offshore drilling and loosen other regulations on fossil fuel development. But just as the surge in oil and gas production in shale fields during the Barack Obama administration had little to do with Washington, the current rise is the result of private companies responding to global markets.\n",
      "Shale fields can be developed relatively quickly and at modest costs relative to the giant projects, whether on land or offshore, that were once favored by big oil companies. That makes it easier to turn investment spigots on or off to adjust to market fluctuations. Companies like Exxon Mobil and Chevron are putting increasing amounts of capital in shale fields, particularly in West Texas and New Mexico.\n",
      "The results go far beyond the economic, offering Washington strategic weapons once unthinkable. The United States and its allies now have a supply cushion at a time when political turmoil in Venezuela, Libya and Nigeria is threatening to interrupt flows to markets.\n",
      "Only a few years ago, such threats — along with a recent pipeline failure in the North Sea and storms in the Gulf of Mexico — would have sent the price of crude soaring. Instead, the rise has been muted, and gasoline at the pump remains below $2.60 a gallon across most of the United States.\n",
      "The new energy power also relieves pressure on Washington to act militarily if tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia break out into war. And it gives Washington the leeway to apply sanctions on other producers — as it has in Russia, and may in Iran or Venezuela — with far less risk to the global economy.\n",
      "It is a striking contrast to the 1970s, when Arab oil boycotts forced motorists to line up for blocks to fill their tanks and the economy went into a tailspin. Even more recently, during the presidency of George W. Bush, domestic oil output was declining so rapidly that the country set a course to replace oil with biofuels like ethanol.\n",
      "Many environmentalists argue that by increasing oil and gas supplies and lowering prices for consumers, shale drilling is extending the life of fossil fuels to the detriment of the environment and the development of cleaner energy.\n",
      "The shale drilling revolution has remade the global energy market, with imports from members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plunging by 20 percent from late 2016 to late 2017. At the same time, exports rose by hundreds of thousands of barrels a day.\n",
      "Nothing like the current situation was foreseen in late 2014, when rising domestic production began weighing on global oil prices.\n",
      "In response, Saudi Arabia led OPEC in a new direction. Instead of throttling back to support prices as the cartel had done so often, it left the market alone and even increased production for a time.\n",
      "Prices fell below $40 a barrel, as the Saudis and their allies hoped to drive American operations out of business by making shale drilling uneconomical. American exploration quickly dropped, but the price squeeze made companies more innovative in the use of drilling technologies, robotics and sensors to maximize output and reduce costs.\n",
      "While scores of smaller companies went out of business, the survivors lengthened horizontal wells to yield more oil, and used clever hedging and drilling strategies to maximize profits even when prices slumped.\n",
      "The response surprised the global oil community. OPEC, Russia and allied producing countries changed course and began cutting back again in 2016.\n",
      "“OPEC missed the point,” said René Ortiz, a former OPEC secretary general and former Ecuadorean energy minister. “They thought they could recover the U.S. market by bringing the prices down. Now the U.S. has gained the leading position in the world oil market regardless of what OPEC does.”\n",
      "“This displacement of Saudi oil, Nigerian oil, Libyan oil and Venezuelan oil,” Mr. Ortiz concluded, “was never anticipated.”\n",
      "A week ago, OPEC leaders met in Oman to discuss a probable extension of production cuts into 2019 to support prices. Their biggest obstacle is the United States.\n",
      "Technological advances unlocking oil from tight rocks like shale has led to a drilling frenzy enabling a doubling of output in a decade, transforming unlikely places like North Dakota and New Mexico into world class petroleum hubs. Pipelines are being built across Texas to serve ports where oil can be pumped onto tankers headed for China, India and other markets.\n",
      "Domestic production last year averaged 9.3 million barrels a day, and the Energy Department projects that the figure will climb to 10.3 million barrels a day this year, surpassing the record set in 1970. In the meantime, since a 40-year export ban was lifted in 2015, exports of American oil have risen to roughly two million barrels a day — more than many OPEC members.\n",
      "The department projects an additional increase in domestic production of 500,000 barrels a day in 2019.\n",
      "Concerns over climate change as well as the growing popularity of electric cars and the eventual aging of the best shale fields will probably curb production and demand over the next few decades. But in the short term, the boom has changed the landscape.\n",
      "The Energy Department projects that the recent surge will hold the price of Brent crude, the global benchmark, to $60 a barrel in 2018 and $61 a barrel in 2019 — a modest increase from $54 last year. (The Brent price rose above $70 a barrel this month, but few analysts see a return to $100-a-barrel oil.)\n",
      "The emerging order in the energy realm is a stable balance of power. Saudi Arabia, which essentially runs OPEC, has put a floor under the oil price — probably around $50 a barrel — with its limits on output and exports over the last four years. But now the United States, by the sheer force of its production, the supremacy of its technology, and an unmatched pipeline, refinery and storage structure, has put a ceiling to the price.\n",
      "Experts note that when oil climbs to $60 a barrel and higher, as it has lately, a drilling rush commences — the national rig count has climbed by over a third in the last year — promising to refill domestic and even global energy inventories. Only a major war or other disruption is likely to send prices soaring.\n",
      "“We have all suffered these depressed prices over the last two years and we are excited to see the new prices and we will respond accordingly,” said Harald Jordan, vice president for engineering at Peak Energy, a Colorado-based producer. “You will see rig activity continue to increase.”\n",

The generation born between 1946 and 1964 is the beginning of a demographic transition that will persist for decades after the baby boomers die, the consequence of lengthening lifespans and declining fertility. Putting the federal budget on a sustainable course requires long-lasting fixes, not short-lived tweaks.  \n",
      "First, a few demographic facts.\n",
      "As the chart below illustrates, there was a surge in births in the U.S. at the end of World War II, a subsequent decline, and then an uptick as baby boomers began having children.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the population has been rising, the number of births in the U.S. the past few years has been below the peak baby-boom levels, possibly because many couples chose not to have children during bad economic times. More significant, fertility rates–roughly the number of babies born per woman during her lifetime–have fallen well below pre-baby-boom levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Americans are living longer. In 1950, a man who made it to age 65 could expect to live until 78 and a woman until 81. Social Security’s actuaries project that a man who lived to age 65 in 2010 will reach 84 and a woman age 86.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Put all this together, and it’s clear that a growing fraction of the U.S. population will be 65 or older.   \n",
      "The combination of longer life spans and lower fertility rates means the ratio of elderly (over 65) to working-age population (ages 20 to 64) is rising. As the chart below illustrates, the ratio will rise steadily as more baby boomers reach retirement age–and then it levels off.  \n",

      "According to President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), approximately 3.1 million jobs will be rendered obsolete or permanently altered as a consequence of artificial intelligence technologies. Artificial intelligence (AI) will, for the foreseeable future, have a significant disruptive impact on jobs. That said, this disruption can create new opportunities if policymakers choose to harness them—including some with the potential to help address long-standing social inequities. Investing in quality training programs that deliver premium skills, such as computational analysis and cognitive thinking, provides a real opportunity to leverage AI’s disruptive power.\n",

      "AI’s disruption presents a clear challenge: competition to traditional skilled workers arising from the cross-relevance of data scientists and code engineers, who can adapt quickly to new contexts. Data analytics has become an indispensable feature of successful companies across all industries. This reality dictates that companies invest heavily in data analytics to remain competitive and profitable. Consequently, unlikely industries such as retail, banking, finance, and even agricultural firms are aggressively competing for talent with specific computational data science and programming skills. A recent IBM report expertly quantifies the scope and breadth of employers’ hiring demands, noting that “[d]emand for data-driven decision makers, such as data-enabled marketing managers, will comprise one-third of the data savvy professional job market, with a projected increase of 110,000 positions by 2020.” Herein lies a window of opportunity: the rapidly growing technical skills gap.\n",
      "Investing in high-quality education and training programs is one way that policymakers proactively attempt to address the workforce challenges presented by artificial intelligence. It is essential that we make affirmative, inclusive choices to ensure that marginalized communities participate equitably in these opportunities.\n",
      "Policymakers should prioritize understanding the demographics of those most likely to lose jobs in the short-run. As opposed to obsessively assembling case studies, we need to proactively identify policy entrepreneurs who can conceive of training policies that equip workers with technical skills of “long-game” relevance. As IBM points out, “[d]ata democratization impacts every career path, so academia must strive to make data literacy an option, if not a requirement, for every student in any field of study.”\n",
      "Machines are an equal opportunity displacer, blind to color and socioeconomic status.\n",
      "Machines are an equal opportunity displacer, blind to color and socioeconomic status. Effective policy responses require collaborative data collection and coordination among key stakeholders—policymakers, employers, and educational institutions—to  identify at-risk worker groups and to inform workforce development strategies. Machine substitution is purely an efficiency game in which workers overwhelmingly lose. Nevertheless, we can blunt these effects by identifying critical leverage points.\n",
      "Investing in innovative education and training is an excellent place to start. Bill Gates’ recent $1.7 billion investment in U.S. public schools is a sign of the way forward, which offers two compelling messages for policymakers. First, innovate and experiment until we identify the right policies. Second, prioritize high-needs schools in poor neighborhoods; they deserve distinct attention to close their opportunity gaps and prepare them to be competitive in the future workforce.\n",
      "Policymakers can choose to harness AI’s disruptive power to address workforce challenges and redesign fair access to opportunity simultaneously. We should train our collective energies on identifying practical policies that update our current agrarian-based education model, which unfairly disadvantages children from economically segregated neighborhoods. Evidence from a Harvard and New York University research study suggests attending a high-quality high school increases a student’s chances of attending a four-year college; which by extension improves their future income earning potential.\n",
      "Let me ask a bold question: how much do we lose if we experiment with substituting an entry-level data science class for machine shop or a vocational carpentry program in urban high schools and community colleges? A 2010 pilot partnership between the University of California, Los Angeles and the National Science Foundation is an encouraging sign; the pilot focuses on redesigning computer science curricula in urban high schools to include newer mobile technologies and computational analysis.\n",

There are many partial explanations for this—local cost of living, differences in education levels, experience, and industry—but none of them quite account for it. It turns out that developers living in San Jose have acquired the specific skills most valued by employers.\n",

Likewise, the cost of living in San Jose is remarkably high, but comparable to other major cities. \n",

Of these, roughly 1.4 million were for software application developers, making it the most in-demand occupation. In total, 3 million ads also contained salary information, which I could use to estimate the average value of each distinct skill advertised. \n",

      "For example, 8.4 percent of ads for software developers in San Jose requested Java, a widely used programming language, associated with an average salary of $98,000 across all U.S. ads mentioning both it and a salary requirement. Yet, for the United States as a whole, just 5.7 percent of software developer ads required Java. In New York City, the share was 6.7, and it was 4.7 in Louisville.\n",

      "Public policy and public affairs schools aim to train competent creators and implementers of government policy. While drawing on the principles that gird our economic and political systems to provide a well-rounded education, like law schools and business schools, policy schools provide professional training. They are quite distinct from graduate programs in political science or economics which aim to train the next generation of academics. As professional training programs, they add value by imparting both the skills which are relevant to current employers, and skills which we know will be relevant as organizations and societies evolve. \n",
      "The relevance of the skills that policy programs impart to address problems of today and tomorrow bears further discussion. We are living through an era in which societies are increasingly interconnected. The wide-scale adoption of devices such as the smartphone is having a profound impact on our culture, communities, and economy. The use of social and digital media and associated means of communication enabled by mobile devices is changing the tone, content, and geographic scope of our conversations, modifying how information is generated and consumed, and changing the very nature of citizen engagement. \n",
      "Information technology-based platforms provisioned by private providers such as Facebook, Google, Uber, and Lyft maintain information about millions of citizens and enable services such as transportation that were mediated in the past solely by the public sector. Surveillance for purposes of public safety via large-scale deployment of sensors also raises fundamental questions about information privacy. From technology-enabled global delivery of work to displacement and replacement of categories of work, some studies estimate that up to 47 percent of U.S. employment might be at risk of computerization with an attendant rise in income inequality. These technology-induced changes will affect every policy domain. How should policy programs best prepare students to address societal challenges in this world that is being transformed by technology? We believe the answer lies in educating students to be “men and women of intelligent action.” \n",
      "A model of policy education\n",
      "We begin with a skills-based model of policy education. These four essential skills address the general problems policy practitioners frequently face:\n",
      "\n",
      "Design skills to craft policy ideas \n",
      "Analytical skills to make smart ex ante decisions \n",
      "Interpersonal experience to manage policy implementation  \n",
      "Evaluative skills to assess outcomes ex post and correct course if necessary\n",
      "\n",
      "These skills make up the policy analysis toolkit required to be data driven practitioner of “intelligent action” in any policy domain. This toolkit needs to be supplemented by an understanding of how technology is transforming societal challenges, enabling new solutions, or disrupting existing regulatory regimes. This understanding is essential to policy formulation and implementation. \n",
      "Pillar 1: Design skills\n",
      "As with engineering, where design precedes analysis, this first pillar seeks to educate students in thinking creatively about problems in order to devise and develop policy ideas. Using ideas derived from design, divergent and convergent thinking principles are employed to generate, explore, and arrive at a candidate set of solutions. Using Uber as an example, an approach to identify and explore the key policy issues such as convenience, costs, driver working hours, and insurance would involve interviewing and observing both incumbent taxi drivers and Uber drivers. This in turn would lead to a set of alternatives that deserve further and careful consideration.  Using these skills, candidate designs and choices that are generated can be evaluated using the policy analytic toolkit. \n",
      "Pillar 2: Analytical skills\n",
      "At Carnegie Mellon, we are often cited in media and interrogated by peers on our approach to analytical and technology skills education. Curiosity about which skills are the “right” skills to teach policy practitioners are common, but we believe this is the wrong approach. We instead begin from the premise that policy or management decisions should be grounded in evidence.  We then determine the skills required to assemble the types of evidence that will likely be available to policy makers in the future.  In increasingly instrumented environments where citizens and infrastructure produce continuous streams of data, making sense of it all will require a somewhat different set of skills. We believe that a grounding in micro-economics, operations research, statistics, and program evaluation (aka causal inference) to be an essential core to policy programs. \n",
      "New coursework will teach students to work with multi-variable data and machine learning with an emphasis on prediction. This material ought to be part of the required coursework in statistics given the importance of prediction in many policy implementation settings. Along the same lines, the ability to work with unstructured data (especially text) and data visualization will become increasingly relevant to all students, not just those students who want to specialize in data analytics. Finally, knowledge of data manipulation and analysis languages such as Python and R for analytic work will be important because data often has to be massaged and cleansed prior to analysis. An important task for programs will be to determine the competencies expected of graduates. \n",
      "Pillar 3: Interpersonal experiences\n",
      "The third pillar of the skills-based model is interpersonal experience, where the practiced habits of good communication and steady negotiation developed with a sound understanding of organizations, their design and their behaviors. We label these purposely as experiences rather than skills because we believe they are best practiced either in the real-world or in simulated real-world settings. It is also in this pillar where practitioners learn the knowledge necessary to become credible experts in their domain. We believe that in addition to core coursework in the area, a supplementary curriculum which provides students with opportunities to gain these experiences is an essential component of our educational model.\n",

      "The ability to carefully diagnose the effectiveness of policy or management interventions is the fourth pillar of our model. It is insufficient to create and execute policy without measurement, and this is where both careful thought to the fundamental issues of measurement and evaluation become important. The ability to make objective judgments on the benefits, liabilities, and unintended consequences of prior policies is the goal of this set of skills. Here, sound statistical and econometric training with an understanding of the principles of causal inference is essential. In addition, program evaluation skills such as cost-benefit and financial analysis help practitioners round out their evaluation skills by considering both non-monetary and economic impacts.\n",
      "What should be retired?\n",
      "A skills-based approach might replace certain aspects of existing policy training.  This depends on a number of factors specific to each institution, but three generally applicable observations are clear. First, real-world experiences are a powerful way to encode domain learning as well as project management skills. Through project-based work, students can learn about institutional contexts in specific policy domains and political processes such as budgeting. Second, team-based projects allow students to learn and apply principles of management and organizational behavior. At Carnegie Mellon, we refer to these as “systems synthesis” projects, since they require students to adopt a systemic point of view and to synthesize a number of skills in their policy analysis toolkit. Third, interpersonal skills training can be practiced through activities such as weekend negotiation exercises, hackathons, and speaker series. These activities can be highly intentional and fashioned to reinforce skills rather than as a recess from the “real work” of classroom training. Since students complete graduate programs in such a short time, counseling them to focus on outcomes from day one will allow them to choose a reinforcing set of coursework and real-world experiences. \n",
      "In summary, we argue for a model of policy education that views practitioners as future problem solvers. Good policy education must consider the ways in which problems will present themselves, and the ways in which answers will obscure themselves. Rigorous training grounded in the analysis of available evidence and buoyed by real-world interpersonal experiences is a sound approach to relevant, durable policy training.\n",

      "Amidst growing frustration with the cost of higher education, complaints also abound about its quality. One critique, launched in the book Academically Adrift by two sociologists, finds little evidence that college students score better on measures of critical thinking, writing, and reasoning after attending college. This is something of a paradox, since strong evidence shows that attending college tends to raise earnings power, even for students who start with mediocre preparation. \n",
      "Our recent study uses a different approach to assess the value of a college education. We find that the particular skills listed by a college’s alumni on their resumes predict how well graduates from those schools perform in terms of earning a living, meeting debt obligations, and working for high-paying or innovative companies. Since jobs requiring more valuable skills typically require at least some college education, this finding suggests many students are gaining valuable skills from college. But the variation in alumni skills across schools is wide, even after considering the aptitude of the students in terms of their pre-admission test scores. This variation implies that what one studies and where have big effects on economic outcomes.\n",

      "\n",
      "It is widely known that education raises individual earnings, but education—measured in years of study or level of degree—is a very rough measure of learning. Thus, it is not surprising that studies consistently find that skills are an important predictor of economic outcomes. People with higher test scores—another measure of learning—earn higher wages, even with the same level of education. Likewise, graduates with technical degrees earn more, as do workers in occupations requiring more STEM skills. At the international scale, performance on standardized exams has a much stronger statistical relationship with economic outcomes than do years of education, according to a new OECD study.\n",

      "\n",
      "Using data from the company Burning Glass, we calculated the average salary listed for distinct skills based on 3 million job vacancy ads. To match these skills to colleges, we used data from LinkedIn’s college profile pages, which show the 25 most common skills (e.g., customer service, Microsoft Excel, Python) listed by alumni from each college. For the average college, we observed 1,150 profiles per skill. (A great advantage of using LinkedIn data is the large sample size.) We obtained data for 2,164 colleges representing profiles for 2.5 million U.S. residents who attended college. By comparison, Academically Adrift surveyed 2,300 college graduates.\n",

      "\n",
      "Measured at mid-career (meaning at least 10 years of working), salaries tend to be much higher for alumni who list high-value skills on their resumes. Earnings go up by an average of $2,600 for every decile of skill. Our more detailed empirical work shows that skills predict higher earnings even after controlling for math test scores on the ACT and SAT, as well as other student characteristics like family income.\n",
      "Cal Tech graduates list the highest-value skills (e.g., Matlab, Python, C++, algorithms, and machine learning) and typically earn $126,000 at mid-career. Other four-year schools with high-value skills and high salaries include Harvey Mudd, MIT, the Polytechnic Institute of New York University, and the Air Force Academy. \n",
      "Earnings data from two-year colleges are not as widely available, and the correlation with alumni skills is weaker, but alumni from those schools also seem to benefit from higher skills training. Top schools include the Pittsburg Institute of Aeronautics, Spartan College of Aeronautics and Technology (Tulsa, Okla.), Coleman University (San Diego), Hondros College (Columbus, Ohio), and SUNY College of Technology at Alfred.\n",

      "As an alternative to mid-career earnings, we also analyzed how skills predict the ability to make student loan payments immediately after graduation. Here too, more valuable skills translate into labor market success. For example, not a single Harvey Mudd attendee between 2009 and 2011 defaulted on his or her federal loans within three years of leaving. Repayment rates average 95 percent for four-year colleges in the top 10 percent for alumni skills but 87 percent for those in the bottom 10 percent. For two-year colleges, repayment rates are uniformly lower, but colleges offering higher-value skills still have significantly higher repayment rates than those that do not.\n",

      "Another outcome measure is whether alumni work for a desirable company or organization. LinkedIn lists the 25 enterprises that employ the most alumni from each school. To quantify the value of working for a given entity, employers were coded for desirability with data from a 2014 survey of 46,000 U.S. college students in 329 universities, developed by Universum, a corporate marketing intelligence company. A total of 212 employers, including government agencies, made it onto a top 100 list for at least one group of student majors. The most desirable employers across majors were Google, Disney, Apple, Microsoft, the FBI, Nike, NASA, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Peace Corps, and Facebook. \n",
      "For the top 10 percent of four-year colleges on alumni skills, half of LinkedIn alumni profiles indicate employment at one of the 212 top-rated companies, compared to just one in four for schools in the bottom 10 percent. For two-year schools, nearly two in five alumni (37 percent) of top-tier schools by skill worked for a top company, versus one in five alumni (21 percent) of bottom-tier schools.\n",
      "For placement at Google specifically, Harvey Mudd has the highest rate—2 percent of all alumni—followed by Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, Caltech, and MIT.

      "Earnings and other economic outcomes should not be equated with social value, and there are plenty of jobs and professions—child care, teaching, social work—that pay modestly but are nevertheless highly valuable to society. Colleges that specialize in this training or instill even moderately valuable skills in the least academically prepared students may be socially important institutions even if their alumni frequently are less affluent.\n",
      "Nonetheless, earnings clearly matter privately and socially, as does work that supports innovation and highly productive advanced industries. Many colleges offer programs of study in fields that appear to have almost no market value—nor even any social value since the knowledge acquired is never put to use, at least through paid employment. In this sense, how well colleges instill highly valuable skills and prepare students to contribute productively to the economy should be an important consideration when evaluating schools. Colleges that do this for the students least likely to otherwise succeed are offering an even more beneficial service, as we have discussed in our value-added college research.\n",

      "TITLE:\n",
      "While the world is fixated on Iraq and the Middle East, North Korea continues to pose at least as great a threat to Western security interests. Six-party talks with the North Koreans in Beijing have just showed that the Bush administration hasn’t yet found a way out of the nuclear crisis. Although negotiations appear likely to resume in a couple of months, their prospects for success seem poor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The basic dilemma is easy to understand. North Korea will not surrender its nuclear capabilities, which are among its only valuable national assets, unless offered a very good deal for giving them up. President Bush refuses to offer such a deal because he sees the North Korean demand as blackmail. He insists that before any talks about better diplomatic relations or economic interaction occur, North Korea first relinquish—with verification—a nuclear program it had pledged nine years ago to abandon completely. At most, Bush may, as an interim gesture, offer to sign a multilateral accord in which all six parties (the two Koreas, the United States, China, Japan and Russia) pledge not to attack each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, in fits and starts North Korea continues its gradual progress toward a larger nuclear capability. Given the regime’s desperate economic straits, its erratic and eccentric and isolated regime and its threats last April that it might even export nuclear materials if circumstances got bad enough, this is extremely bad news.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the extent the Bush administration has a plan for addressing this crisis, it is a strategy of pressure. It insisted on the six-party negotiating format because that allows the other five parties all to insist that North Korea de-nuclearize. That kind of setting also deprives North Korea of its bluster and brinkmanship tactics.\n",

      "For example, when the delegation from Pyongyang used the recent Beijing meeting to accuse the Bush administration of harboring aggressive designs on North Korea, Russia countered that it was confident the United States had no such intention. The Bush administration also has established a creative concept known as the proliferation security initiative, by which countries such as the United States, Japan, Australia, France and Germany make use of existing national laws to inspect North Korean ships in their waters—complicating North Korea’s efforts to smuggle illicit weapons, drugs and counterfeit currency.\n",

      "\n",
      "Faced with this dilemma, we need to think bigger. We must offer much more to North Korea but demand far more in return. The goal should be to push North Korea, which has shown increasing interest in economic reform, to seriously attempt such reform—building on the precedents offered by China and Vietnam in the past two decades. If North Korea is willing and takes steps, such as cutting its conventional military forces, that are needed to give such a plan any hope of success, we can be generous in return. This would not be giving in to blackmail; it would be a form of assisted suicide for the Stalinist ways of the North Korean regime. Even if Kim Jong Il and his cronies survived the transition, their rule would be radically transformed.\n",
      "\n",
      "This plan would require the help of all six parties that are now part of the negotiating process. Chinese economists and technicians would teach the North Koreans how to carry out market reforms. Russia would reassure Kim Jong Il and his military commanders that intrusive arms control verification can be done without opening up the country to attack. Japan and South Korea would provide aid and investment; South Korea would also have to make at least modest cuts in its conventional forces in return for much deeper cuts in the oversized North Korean military.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the nuclear and conventional military issues, North Korea would also agree to verifiable elimination of its chemical weapons and ballistic missiles. It would cease counterfeiting and drug trafficking. It would have to let all Japanese kidnapping victims leave and begin a human rights dialogue with the outside world. It would continue to abstain from terrorism and provocative actions against its neighbors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The United States would, for its part, ease trade sanctions immediately and ultimately lift them. It would, together with its regional partners and international financial institutions, provide at least $2 billion a year in aid to North Korea. The aid would not be in the form of cash (or new nuclear reactors), and would not be provided in one big dose but would be disbursed incrementally—while we watched to make sure North Korea was also holding up its end of the grand bargain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diplomatic ties and security assurances leading to a full peace treaty would also be appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, this approach might well fail. North Korean leaders may, for example, believe they need nuclear weapons to deter the Bush administration from another preemptive action against another charter member of the axis of evil. But it would be a major mistake to act on that assumption before testing it. And if we try and fail, coercive policies may then become possible, as our regional partners will have a much harder time claiming that diplomacy has not yet been seriously attempted.\n",

      "America’s urban landscape is changing. The familiar distinctions between central cities and suburbs and between the growing Sunbelt and the more stagnant Frostbelt parts of the country are being complicated by new demographic trends, two in particular. The first trend is the sharp rise in immigration to the United States. Each year about one million people, predominantly Latin American and Asian in origin, arrive in the United States, most settling in urban areas. The second trend involves the baby-boomers. This large cohort of 76 million people?often termed “the pig in the python”?is now aging toward the tail of that python. Most boomers will not move but “age in place”?in the suburbs rather than in the city. Both these trends will have important effects on urban America.\n",

      "Beyond the “White-Black, City-Suburb” Typology \n",
      "For much of the postwar period, discussions of race and space in urban America revolved around black migration to central cities and “white flight” to the suburbs. The new immigration that is infusing many urban areas with new residents from a variety of backgrounds suggests the need for a new way of thinking about the demographic profiles of cities and suburbs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The impact of immigration is apparent from a glance at the central counties (those that contain a metropolitan area’s central-city population) showing greatest population gains during 1990?99. The two largest gainers, Maricopa County, home of Phoenix, and Clark County, home of Las Vegas, achieved most of their gains from domestic migration?migrants from other parts of the United States. Yet each of the next five central counties with the greatest population gains?those of the Los Angeles, Houston, San Diego, Miami, and Dallas metropolitan areas?registered a net loss of domestic migrants. Their gains came entirely from international migration and natural increase. Were it not for immigration, the population of these areas, and of several other large central counties, would register far smaller growth or outright declines. Indeed, areas that do not attract nearly as many immigrants?the central counties of Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, Cleveland, and Buffalo, among others?lost population over the 1990s.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because conventional city-suburb, black-white demographic profiles do not take adequate account of this new immigration, I offer a new typology of the nation’s large metropolitan areas, those with populations greater than 1 million (see table 1).\n",

      "The typology begins with a Multiethnic High Immigration category of 12 metropolitan areas with high immigration and a significant Asian or Hispanic presence. The largest of these areas are New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco. Four other categories cover areas that have a primarily black minority presence and those that are mostly white; and within each, those growing at a relatively high pace and those growing only modestly. These four categories are: White-Black Fast-Growing (for example, Atlanta), White-Black Slow-Growing (Detroit), Mostly White Fast-Growing (Las Vegas), and Mostly White Slow-Growing (Pittsburgh).\n",
      "\n",
      "In metropolitan areas where white-black racial dynamics have been a historically important demographic dimension, the slow-growing areas tend to be in the Rustbelt (New Orleans being an exception), and the fast-growing areas are located in the Southeast, which has now begun to attract back significant numbers of African Americans. Mostly White Fast-Growing areas are located primarily in the West and Midwest (Orlando, Nashville, and West Palm Beach excepted). Mostly White Slow-Growing areas are located in the Northeast and Midwest (Louisville excepted).\n",

      "Table 2 gives the composite racial profiles for cities and suburbs in each of these five categories. Multiethnic High Immigration areas clearly have the greatest diversity both in their cities and in their suburbs although the suburbs remain majority white. Among the White-Black categories, the slow-growing areas show a lesser tendency toward black suburbanization.\n",
      "\n",
      "What these statistics show is that the conventional view of cities as being in decline and as having predominantly black populations fails to take into account recent changes in the urban scene. Today some of the nation’s fastest-growing cities are gaining population from domestic migration and are mostly white. And several large multiethnic metropolitan areas house “majority minorities” in their cities and may soon do so in their suburbs as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old “city-suburb” typology also fails to recognize heterogeneous growth patterns within the suburbs. Many inner and even middle suburbs are experiencing demographic dynamics similar to those of the cities. This is especially the case in some of the largest “melting pot” metropolitan areas. A look at the immigration and domestic migration dynamics for counties within the greater Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York CMSAs (Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas) shows that it is not just the inner counties whose gains are attributable solely to international migration. Of the 29 counties in the greater New York CMSA, fully 20 registered negative domestic migration during 1990?99 and achieved their only migration growth from immigration from abroad. The same goes for 4 of the 5 counties in the Los Angeles CMSA and for 7 of the 10 counties of the San Francisco CMSA.\n",
      "\n",
      "The heterogeneity of suburbs was already apparent in 1990. Figure 1 compares the Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Detroit metropolitan areas. The racially diverse suburbs of Los Angeles, with their infusion of immigrants and new ethnic minorities, contrast with the suburbs of Atlanta, which show moderate racial heterogeneity, and those of slower-growing Detroit, where historical racial antagonisms keep the divide between city and suburbs fairly sharp.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suburban growth patterns continue to favor the outer suburbs. Of the 30 counties that made the fastest gains via net domestic migration during 1990?99, most that are in metropolitan areas lie in the outer suburban reaches of fast-growing metropolitan areas such as Denver, Atlanta, Las Vegas, Dallas, and Houston. Even in the fast-growing, less dense portions of the country, an outer suburban residence remains popular.\n",
      "Aging Boomers, Cities, and Suburbs\n",
      "Since the baby-boom generation began entering grade school in the 1950s, it has been followed closely by marketers, policymakers, and political consultants. But the boomers’ sharp disengagement from the residential aspects of city life seems to have escaped the notice of urban watchers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aging of the nation’s first suburban generation will increase substantially the number of households in their 50s and early 60s over the next 10 years. Early boomers?born between 1945 and 1955?will be making the transition from empty-nesters to preretirees. Many will retire from regular jobs. Some will leave their suburban homes. But most will “age in place” or perhaps make a local move.\n",
      "\n",
      "The late boomers?those born between 1955 and 1964?will still be in their prime career and prime earnings ages. Some will be looking to upgrade their housing, again in the same local area. They will have fewer children living at home than did earlier generations at the same age?and therefore more freedom in their location decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some observers have expressed the hope that these huge boomer generations might be a source for central-city revival. But the hope seems unrealistic, given the current location of this “suburban generation.” With the exception of Hispanics, baby-boomers, now in the 35-54 age groups, are less likely to reside in the city than either today’s elderly or adults now in their 20s and early 30s.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, elderly growth patterns during the 1990s show that the “graying of the suburbs” is well under way. Of the 30 counties with fastest-gaining elderly populations over the 1990s, most are either in nonmetropolitan areas or in middle or outer suburban counties of fast-growing metropolitan areas. Much of this simply reflects the aging-in-place of elderly who have moved to these fast-growing metropolitan areas during their lifetimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The projected gains in elderly over the next 25 years will occur in the Mostly White Fast-Growing and White-Black Fast-Growing areas discussed earlier. While some of this growth will be attributable to retirement migration to high amenity areas of the Mountain West and South, most will result from the aging-in-place of boomers who relocated there during their working lives or at least before retirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "This suggests somewhat different patterns of growth for the new immigrant minorities than for largely white or white and black baby-boomers. Much of the boomer growth and, hence, the projected elderly gains will be in the suburbs of major metropolitan areas and in regions of the country that are not capturing new immigrant minorities. Within metropolitan areas the better-off and healthy “yuppie elderly” will tend to locate on the periphery, and the more disadvantaged segments of the older population will reside closer in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Central cities and inner suburbs in metropolitan regions that have suffered economic and demographic declines in recent decades will continue to house disproportionate numbers of the nation’s disadvantaged elderly?older elderly people, widows and widowers, female-headed households, those with incomes below or near the poverty level and relatively high levels of disability. As they continue to age in place, they will pose special challenges for local institutions that are often the most financially strapped.\n",
      "\n",
      "But although the aging of the baby-boomers will have different effects for cities and suburbs, dealing with the social services, health care, and transportation needs of a faster-growing senior population will prove a challenge to cities and suburbs alike.\n",
      "New Forces at Work\n",
      "The advent of new immigrants and the aging of the baby-boomers will surely complicate both urban and suburban race-ethnic and aging demographic dynamics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The demographics of Los Angeles provide just one example of how the two countervailing trends could operate. As a result of the successive outmigration of whites, juxtaposed with the continued waves of immigration of new ethnic minorities, Los Angeles County’s elderly population is still majority white, its working-aged population is only about one-third white, and its child population is predominantly Hispanic and other racial and ethnic groups. Reflecting their age, the growing racial and ethnic groups in Los Angeles will be concerned with issues of affordable housing, good schools, and neighborhoods conducive to the raising of children. And, reflecting their age, whites are likely to be more concerned with health and social support services for an aging dependent population. Whether the same kind of “racial generation gap” will occur in other melting pot metropolitan areas remains to be seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever else the new urban population profiles show, the old models of dealing with cities and suburbs will need to be revised to adapt to new demographic forces in America today.\n",

      "Conversations around data science typically contain a lot of buzzwords and broad generalizations that make it difficult to understand its pertinence to governance and policy. Even when well-articulated, the private sector applications of data science can sound quite alien to public servants. This is understandable, as the problems that Netflix and Google strive to solve are very different than those government agencies, think tanks, and nonprofit service providers are focused on. This does not mean, however, that there is no public sector value in the modern field of data science. With qualifications, data science offers a powerful framework to expand our evidence-based understanding of policy choices, as well as directly improve service delivery.\n",
      "To better understand its importance to public policy, it’s useful to distinguish between two broad (though highly interdependent) trends that define data science. The first is a gradual expansion of the types of data and statistical methods that can be used to glean insights into policy studies, such as predictive analytics, clustering, big data methods, and the analysis of networks, text, and images. The second trend is the emergence of a set of tools and the formalization of standards in the data analysis process. These tools include open-source programming languages, data visualization, cloud computing, reproducible research, as well as data collection and storage infrastructure.\n",
      "Source: Alex Engler/The University of Chicago\n",
      "Perhaps not coincidentally, these two trends align reasonably well with the commonly cited data science Venn diagram. In this diagram, data science is defined as the overlap of computer science (the new tools), statistics (the new data and methods), and critically, the pertinent domain knowledge (in our case, economics and public policy). While it is a simplification, it is still a useful and meaningful starting point. Moving beyond this high-level understanding, the goal of this paper is to explain in depth the first trend, illuminating why an expanded view of data and statistics has meaningful repercussions for both policy analysts and consumers of that analysis.\n",
      "Traditional evidence-building for policy analysis\n",
      "Using data to learn about public policy is not at all new. The origins of the social sciences using statistical analysis of observational data goes back at least to the 1950s, and experiments started even further back. Microsimulation models, less common but outsized in their influence, emerged as the third pillar of data-driven policy analysis in the 1970s. Beyond descriptive statistics, this trifecta—experiments, observational statistical analysis, and microsimulation—dominated the quantitative analysis of policy for around 40 years. To this day, they constitute the overwhelming majority of empirical knowledge about policy efficacy. While recent years have seen a substantial expansion in the set of pertinent methods (more on that below), it is still critical to have a strong grasp of experiments, observational causal inference, and microsimulation.\n",
      " @import url(https://c24215cec6c97b637db6-9c0895f07c3474f6636f95b6bf3db172.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/interactives/2020/accordions-v2/app.css); \n",
      "Experiments\n",
      "Since public policy can’t be conducted in a laboratory, experiments are rare in policy studies. Experiments require random assignment, which for policy means a benefit or program is made available randomly to some people and not to others—hardly a politically popular strategy. Many would also say it is ethically questionable to do this, though randomized experiments have taken firm root in medicine, sacrificing fairness in the short term for progress in the long term. Regardless of the political and ethical barriers, they do happen. Experiments are most often supported by nonprofits or created by an accident of governance, and can produce relatively rigorous results, compared to the other methods discussed here.\n",
      "Perhaps the most famous experiment in modern public policy is that of the Oregon Medicaid expansion. When Oregon moved to expand access to Medicaid in 2008 (before the Affordable Care Act), the state quickly realized that it could not afford to cover all the individuals eligible under the loosened criteria. Opting to randomly select which residents would be able to receive benefits, Oregon officials created the perfect circumstances for researchers to compare recipients of Medicaid with non-recipients who were otherwise very similar. Professors Katherine Baicker and Amy Finkelstein led the research efforts, resulting in extensive evidence that Medicaid improved some health outcomes and prevented catastrophic medical expenses, while also increasing health-care utilization and costs. Signaling a growing interest in this approach, the recent Nobel Prize in Economics recognized three scholars who have taken experiments (sometimes call randomized control trials, or RCTs) into the developing world to examine how to best tackle global poverty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Statistical analysis of observational data\n",
      "Due to the financial and political difficulties that experiments present, they remain rare, and much more research is based on the statistical analysis of observational data. Observational data refers to information collected without the presence of an explicit experiment—it comes from surveys, government administrative data, nonprofit service delivery, and other sources. Usually by obtaining and combining several datasets, researchers look for various opportunities to examine the causal effects of policy changes with statistical methods. These statistical methods, broadly called causal inference statistics (or quasi-experiments), take advantage of differences within populations, or policy changes over time and geography to estimate how effective a service or intervention is.\n",
      "Individually, the strength of the evidence from a single study is limited. (This is true in any field, and it suggests prudence when changing your beliefs based on results from one study.) However, since observational data is far easier to gather and analyze than experimental data, it is possible to find many opportunities to re-examine the same policy questions. Eventually, it’s possible to examine many papers on the same subject, called a meta-analysis. Meta-analysis of observational studies have convincingly argued that increased school spending improves student outcomes, gun access leads to higher risk of suicide and homicide, and that taxes on sugary beverages are associated with lower demand for those beverages.\n",
      "Although at times difficult to interpret, this slow accumulation of many observational analyses by different research groups often becomes the most informative and trustworthy source of information about potential policy changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Microsimulation\n",
      "Although microsimulation is a lesser-known type of modeling, it remains a critical one. The news is frequently covered in estimates from microsimulation methods, such as how effective taxes would change under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and how many people would lose health insurance under the curtailing of the Affordable Care Act. Even a substantial part of the (in)famous Congressional Budget Office scoring of the cost of federal legislation employs microsimulation.\n",
      "The Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center model is perhaps the easiest to understand intuitively. The model starts with a sample of anonymized administrative data from the Internal Revenue Service, which contains lots of information about taxpayers that is specific to each person. (This puts the “micro” in microsimulation.) The model itself then does the same thing as online tax preparation software: It runs through the rules of the tax code and calculates how much this person should be paying in taxes. However, the model contains many different knobs that can be turned and switches that can be flicked, each one changing something about the way the tax code works. By altering some of these inputs, the model creates a simulation, that is, an alternative possible outcome from the real world of tax policy.\n",
      "These models are highly complex, and usually take years to build. They also require a lot of information about how a set of public policies are currently affecting a population, so the data typically comes from government administration records. However, once they are built, they offer a quick and flexible lens into potential policy changes. In reality, the behavioral consequences—how people and firms react to new policy—are large enough that few experts are ever really convinced that estimates from these models are precisely correct. That said, microsimulation methods can ground policy discussions to reasonable predictions, make assumptions explicit, and give a reasonable sense of what complex and interacting policy changes might do. Compared to letting pundits invent numbers out of thin air, microsimulation offer a dramatically more rigorous approach to estimating policy outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The expanded methods of data science for policy analysis\n",
      "Nothing discussed above falls outside the field of data science. These approaches all use data, programming, and statistics to infer meaningful conclusions about the world. Still, the term “data science” has some value, as it connotes a broader set of methods and data types than is traditional to the field of policy analysis. While many of these methods have existed for a long time, the proliferation of new and diverse data sources means this expanded toolkit should be more widely understood and applied by policy analysts. Many of the methods detailed below fall into the field of machine learning, but in this case, that terminology complicates the issue without adding much clarity.\n",
      " @import url(https://c24215cec6c97b637db6-9c0895f07c3474f6636f95b6bf3db172.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/interactives/2020/accordions-v2/app.css); \n",
      "Predictive analytics\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a growing recognition that many government and nonprofit services can be improved with predictive analytics. In Chicago, predictive models are used to reduce the exposure of young children to lead paint, which has extensive and permanent health consequences. Before this effort, and still in most places across the United States, exposed lead paint is typically only discovered after children fall ill.\n",
      "The Chicago model uses historical inspection data to find correlations between exposed lead paint and other information (like the age of the buildings, when they were last renovated, if they have been vacant, as well as demographic data). This model can then be used to evaluate the level of risk of lead paint in homes that are going to accommodate newborn children. Using those predictions, the Chicago Department of Public Health can more strategically prioritize lead paint inspections, saving many children from hazardous exposure.\n",
      "This is a generalizable approach for service providers who have a valuable intervention, limited resources, and uncertainty in where their investments would be most beneficial. As another example, the Center for Data Insights at MDRC—a nonprofit, nonpartisan education and social policy research organization—is exploring how to use prediction modeling to better allocate employment services to former inmates. (Disclosure: I am a data science consultant on this project.) If there is trustworthy historical data and an opportunity to affect who gets an intervention, predictive analytics can be highly beneficial by getting services delivered to those who need it most.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clustering\n",
      "\n",
      "In public policy, subgroups of a larger population can be very important. Some students score highly on tests, while other score poorly. Some people earn a lot of money from their jobs, while others earn very little. However, although it is tempting to think of groups as separated along a single variable, like the examples above, this is infrequently the case. Some people may earn little money from their jobs, but are in fact in graduate school, have highly educated parents with a strong social support system, suggesting that their income potential is quite high. In some cases, they may be more similar to people earning lots of money than those who earn little but do not have those other supports.\n",
      "Clustering methods allow for the discovery of these underlying groups across many variables that might otherwise remain hidden or avoid our qualitative intuition. The Pew Research Center has demonstrated this by using clustering methods to examine our assumptions about the political spectrum. Pew researchers applied clustering methods to a survey with 23 questions about political opinions. They discovered that the traditional liberal-moderate-conservative spectrum does not effectively compass the many dimensions of political views that Americans hold. Instead, they argued for seven distinct political subgroups. As just one difference, this more nuanced political analysis notes two groups of conservatives: one more socially conservative, but also critical of Wall-Street; and another more socially moderate, pro-immigration, but also pro-Wall Street.\n",
      "This is closer to how the world really works—subgroups are complex and nothing is unidimensional. It’s imperative to consider how many variables may be interacting to define the most meaningful differences in whatever populations are being analyzed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Big data\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes, though certainly not always, simply having more data enables better or different policy analysis. Over the past 12 years, a joint academic initiative at MIT Sloan and Harvard Business School has been using online prices to measure macroeconomic indicators. By scraping data from the internet, the Billion Prices Project has collected the prices of 15 million items from over a thousand retailers. This massive dataset has enabled them to create measures of inflation in 20 countries, updated on a daily basis. For the sake of comparison, the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) Consumer Price Index is monthly. Although there are many challenges to this new approach, it’s worth keeping in mind that the traditional process used by the BLS (government employees surveying or physically examining prices) is far more expensive, complicated by its own problems (e.g., growing survey non-response), and painstakingly slow.\n",
      "While big data can offer new insights, there are important statistical differences when analyzing big data. Most notably, it is generally harder to get data that accurately represents the whole of a population (like a country or a state). Cloud computing and modern software may easily enable analyzing multi-billion row datasets, but that makes it no easier to know who the data is relevant to. Phone records can illuminate strategies to improve traffic patterns, but does it overlook people without mobile phones? Credit card transactions can reveal lifestyle differences across socio-economic groups, but what could be missing without seeing cash transactions and cash-only consumers? This remains a large problem for effectively using big data that is not originally meant for social science (sometimes called “found data”). As a result, it’s a priority to continue the development of methods that can adjust these datasets to be representative and accurate, especially since this new data can offer so much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Text analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "Modern text analysis, or natural language processing, offers new ways to glean meaningful insights into the huge bodies of writing that societies produce. For example, consider the impressions that a community has of its law enforcement officers. Trust in the legitimacy of a police force can lead to more lawful behavior, as well as community collaboration to solve and reduce crimes. However, community impressions of police can be hard to measure. This is why the Urban Institute turned to Twitter. Researchers at Urban’s Justice Policy Center analyzed the sentiment of 65 million tweets, finding spikes in negative sentiment after violent police-citizen interactions. It’s worth nothing that this analysis is affected by the big data considerations detailed above.\n",
      "In another instance, my colleagues in Brookings’s Metropolitan Policy Program looked for overlapping patterns in the text of job descriptions and AI patents. This allows them to create a quantitative estimate of how good AI might be at various job tasks, and thereby, how potentially automatable those jobs might be. This approach creates a new way to reason about the effects of automation that is less dependent on the qualitative judgement of experts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Network analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "In their book, “Network Propaganda,” three researchers of Harvard’s Berkman-Klein Center created networks of online media sources, like The New York Times and Fox News. They then measured the sources’ relationships to one another with the hyperlinks in their news content, as well as the social media sharing patterns of their audience. Critically, their research has shown how isolated and self-amplifying far-right media sources have become, leading them to grow more extreme and less tethered to the truth. This is the exact type of insight that network analysis can help deliver: Around whom is the network most dependent? Who is on the fringes and sidelines? How are relationships between actors changing?\n",
      "While the internet and social media has created huge networks of people, any group of things with relationships to one another can be considered a network and analyzed as such. The states have long been considered laboratories of democracy, where experimental policies can be tested and successful ones shared. This also can be conceived of as a network, with states being connected to one another through the diffusion of similar legislation. Recent research of this kind has provided further evidence of California’s status as a leader in policy innovation. This might be unsurprising, but the same research also highlights Kentucky as the most influential state for the diffusion of public policy from the 1960s until California's emergence in the mid-1990s.\n",
      "\n",
      "Image analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "Image data has proliferated in recent years, originating in everything from cell phones, traffic cameras, smart devices, and even constellations of new satellites. In many parts of the word, especially poor countries, it can be very hard to develop an accurate understanding of poverty—but analyzing image data can help. Unsurprisingly, knowing where impoverished people are is vital to targeting services and investments to help improve their socio-economic outcomes. This is why the World Bank has been developing methods to use high-definition satellite data to create geographically specific measures of poverty, especially relevant to the 57 countries with almost no survey data on poverty. Data science methods can look at satellite imagery and recognize cars, identify roofing materials, distinguish between paved and unpaved roads, and measure building height and density. In turn, these new variables can be used to estimate fairly accurate poverty measures that are substantial improvements over outdated (or nonexistent) estimates.\n",
      "Satellite data has also been used to monitor international conflicts and as evidence of human rights abuses. Other efforts have proposed using social media photos of political protests to measure their size and degree of violence, though this is likely not ready for implementation. Currently, image analysis is largely limited to facial and object recognition; it is not close to genuine understanding of photos. Still, as imagery proliferates and related modeling techniques improve, this data will offer powerful new ways to examine the state of the world.\n",

      "Why data science matters to public policy and governance\n",
      "Evaluating data is becoming a core component of government oversight. The actions of private companies are more frequently in databases than file cabinets, and having that digital information obscured from regulators will undermine our societal safeguards. Government agencies should already be acting to evaluate problematic AI-hiring software and seeking to uncover biases in models that determine who gets health interventions. As algorithmic decision-making becomes more common, it will be necessary to have a core of talented civic data scientists to audit their use in regulated industries.\n",
      "Even for public servants who never write code themselves, it will be critical to have enough data science literacy to meaningfully interpret the proliferation of empirical research. Despite recent setbacks—such as proposed cuts to evidence-building infrastructure in the Trump administration’s budget proposal—evidence-based policymaking is not going anywhere in the long term. There are already 125 federal statistical agencies, and the Foundations of Evidence Based Policymaking Act, passed early last year, expands the footprint and impact of evidence across government programs.\n",
      "“Even for public servants who never write code themselves, it will be critical to have enough data science literacy to meaningfully interpret the proliferation of empirical research.”\n",
      "Further, the mindset of a data scientist is tremendously valuable for public servants: It forces people to confront uncertainty, consider counterfactuals, reason about complex patterns, and wonder what information is missing. It makes people skeptical of anecdotes, which, while often emotionally powerful, are not sufficient sources of information on which to build expansive policies. The late and lauded Alice Rivlin knew all this in 1970, when she published “Systemic Thinking for Social Action.” Arguing for more rigor and scientific processes in government decision-making, Rivlin wrote a pithy final line: “Put more simply, to do better, we must have a way of distinguishing better from worse.”\n",
      "How to encourage data-scientific thinking and evidence-based policies\n",
      "The tools and data to distinguish better from worse are more available than ever before, and more policymakers must know how to use and interpret them. A continued expansion of evidence-based decision-making relies on many individuals in many different roles, adopting practices that encourage data-scientific thinking. Managers in government agencies can hire analysts with a rigorous understanding of data in addition to a background in policy. They can also work to open up their datasets, contributing to Data.gov and the broader evidence-based infrastructure. Grant-making organizations have a critical role, too. They should be mandating an evaluation budget—at least 5% of a grant—to collect data and see if the programs they are funding actually work. When they fund research, it should require replicable research and open-data practices.\n",

      "For policy researchers looking to expand their sense of what is possible, keep an eye on the data science blogs at the Urban Institute and the Pew Research Center, which get into the weeds on how they are using emerging tools to build and disseminate new knowledge. And for current policy analysts who want to deepen their skills, they should consider applying to the Computational Social Science Summer Institute, a free two-week intensive to learn data skills in the context of social problems and policy data. Though much of it is not directly relevant to policy, there is a tremendous amount of online content for self-learners, too. I recommend looking into free online courses and learning to program in R. For those interested in a bigger investment, look to the joint data science and public policy graduate programs, like those at Georgetown University, the University of Chicago, and the University of Pennsylvania.\n",

      "America’s community colleges offer the promise of a more affordable pathway to a bachelor’s degree. Students can pay substantially less for the first two years of college, transfer to a four-year college or university, and still earn their diploma in the same amount of time. At least in theory. Most community college students—80 percent of them—enter with the intention to transfer, but only 20 percent actually do so within five years of entering college. This divide represents a classic case of what behavioralists call an intention-action gap. \n",
      "Why would so many students who enter community colleges intending to transfer fail to actually do so? Put yourself in the shoes of a 20-something community college student. You’ve worked hard for the past couple years, earning credits and paying a lot less in tuition than you would have if you had enrolled immediately in a four-year college or university. But now you want to transfer, so that you can complete your bachelor’s degree. How do you figure out where to go? Ideally you’d probably like to find a college that would take most of your credits, where you’re likely to graduate from, and where the degree is going to count for something in the labor market. A college advisor could probably help you figure this out, but at many community colleges there are at least 1,000 other students assigned to your advisor, so you might have a hard time getting a quality meeting.  Some states have articulation agreements between two- and four-year institutions that guarantee admission for students who complete certain course sequences and perform at a high enough level. But these agreements are often dense and inaccessible. \n",
      "The combination of big data and behavioral insights has the potential to help students navigate these complex decisions and successfully follow through on their intentions. Big data analytic techniques allow us to identify concrete transfer pathways where students are positioned to succeed; behavioral insights ensure we communicate these options in a way that maximizes students’ engagement and responsiveness. \n",
      "The transfer decision is of course only one of many such challenges students and families face in education, where information to help people make informed choices is theoretically available, but often complex and poorly communicated. Parents of toddlers in many states can now access early childcare rating information through Quality Rating Improvement Systems, but in most locations these systems have low visibility. High school students in many schools have a range of courses available to them, but they may not get sufficient counseling on which course sequences best position them for postsecondary education. \n",
      "A growing body of innovative research has demonstrated that, by applying behavioral science insights to the way we communicate with students and families about the opportunities and resources available to them, we can help people navigate these complex decisions and experience better outcomes as a result. A combination of simplified information, reminders, and access to assistance have improved achievement and attainment up and down the education pipeline, nudging parents to practice early-literacy activities with their kids or check in with their high schoolers about missed assignments, and encouraging students to renew their financial aid for college. \n",
      "Big data analytic techniques have the potential to contribute to a next generation of behavioral science interventions in education—strategies that help people overcome complex matching problems like the transfer decision by giving personalized information about educational pathways that both build on the students’ prior experience and best position them for future success. Think of this as Netflix’s movie recommendation algorithm applied to education. There have already been some initial ventures in this direction. In one seminal study, researchers capitalized on student-level academic achievement data from the College Board and publicly-available data on college characteristics to send high-achieving, low-income students semi-customized packets of high-quality colleges and universities where students had a good chance of being admitted based on their academic performance. But there’s also real potential for much greater personalization. \n",
      "Take a community college student’s transfer decision as an example. Working with a state higher education system, researchers and data scientists could use a combination of articulation agreements and data from prior cohorts of students to identify optimal transfer pathways for different student groups and course-taking histories. Using data on current students’ course-taking experiences and contact information they provide to their college, the system could proactively send students messages that identifies specific institutions where they have already met the transfer requirements, or where they are on track to do so, and where prior cohorts of students from their same college have been successful upon transferring. Behavioral scientists can help design this outreach in a way that maximizes student engagement and responsiveness.  \n",
      "These types of big data techniques are already being used in some education sectors. For instance, a growing number of colleges use predictive analytics to identify struggling students who need additional assistance, so faculty and administrators can intervene before the student drops out. But frequently there is insufficient attention, once the results of these predictive analyses are in hand, about how to communicate the information in a way that is likely to lead to behavior change among students or educators. And much of the predictive analytics work has been on the side of plugging leaks in the pipeline (e.g. preventing drop-outs from higher education), rather than on the side of proactively sending students and families personalized information about educational and career pathways where they are likely to flourish. \n",
      "From pre-K through college, students and families have to navigate one complex decision after another—about which schools to attend, what courses to take, which programs to apply for. These decisions are particularly daunting for socioeconomically-disadvantaged families who have less experience navigating complicated educational decisions and less access to professional advising. Families like these also have to devote a substantial portion of their cognitive bandwidth to just making ends meet financially. By leveraging big data techniques and behavioral science insights, we can help families identify educational opportunities that position them for ongoing success. \n",

      "More men than women are killed in car crashes each year, partly because men drive more and engage in riskier driving behavior. On the other hand, women are 17% more likely to be killed and 47% more likely to be injured in crashes than men are. Women are at increased risk simply because they are women: cars are primarily designed, built, and tested by male engineers using male data, so they are built with men in mind. Scaled-down versions of male crash test dummies, meant to represent women, were not used until 2003—and are primarily tested in the passenger seat. In car design, development, and testing, male bodies are the standard and female bodies the outlier. This creates a gender data gap with very real impacts on the lives of Americans.\n",

      "The gender data gap appears in health and medicine, too. Heart disease kills more people in the United States than anything else, accounting for approximately 20% of female deaths and 25% of male deaths. But survival rates for women are substantially worse than they are for men, and the gender data gap is partly to blame. Historically, heart disease research was primarily conducted on male subjects by male scientists and doctors, so male symptoms are considered typical and female symptoms atypical. As a result, women are misdiagnosed up to 50% more often and are more likely to be dismissed without treatment. Even when treated, women are less likely to receive needed medications or advice. And simply including women in research is not enough: when research findings are not sex-disaggregated, men are still considered the norm.[1]\n",
      "The gender data gap affects military service as well. Retention of women is a perennial, persistent, and well-established problem, but the services have never meaningfully tracked why women leave the military at higher rates. A range of factors—rigid career paths, restrictive policies on parental leave and postpartum fitness, and cultural problems such as the Marines United scandal and high sexual assault rates—are suspected to disproportionately impact women. Yet the primarily-male leadership only recently adopted a recommendation to start tracking retention drivers on a voluntary basis. These efforts will remain inadequate until the scope of analysis is broadened, population pool is increased, and time has passed. Until then, the gap remains robust.\n",
      "Rethinking the default\n",
      "The endangerment of American citizens is concerning enough, but the gender data gap also creates a vicious cycle of underrepresentation in leadership across the nation. When leaders are primarily male, they are less likely to consider women as they develop and implement policy. And the policies they enact further neglect women, so the cycle continues. When men become the default, women are an afterthought. Their bodies, needs, and contributions are neglected, and their participation as leaders at every level is limited.\n",
      "If the male perspective is assumed to be the standard and the female perspective is the “other”, the institutions that rest on that assumption, the decision-making processes leaders employ, and the policy choices that result suffer. This limits government effectiveness, and nowhere is this more critical than in the context of national security. To understand security challenges and develop means to successfully address them, leaders must seek the fullest picture possible. If women are not at the decision-making table and those in command do not consider female perspectives, that picture remains incomplete.\n",
      "Closing the gap\n",

      "First, research must explore the gender data gap. Instead of considering the average male the norm, gender diversity in research must be actively sought. By exploring how diverse people are affected by various phenomena, research findings can inform government structures, their functions, and the policies that result.\n",
      "Second, research must explore how diverse teams and leaders impact organizations, particularly in government. The business case for diversity is being established, and research into diversity in other areas is promising: research into diversity in medicine found that female doctors have higher patient survival rates, and male doctors’ performance improved when they worked with female physicians. But the rest of the country must catch up. Research can demonstrate how diversity, particularly gender diversity, affects American lives.\n",

      "Finally, leaders must actively seek diversity. While the gender data gap is narrowed through research, including the perspectives of those who live in the gap can fill in the blanks. There is precedent for this. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325, adopted 19 years ago, established that women must be included at all levels of leadership to achieve peace and stability. The United States’ own Women, Peace, and Security Act of 2017 states that “the political participation and leadership of women…is critical to sustaining democratic institutions; and… helps promote more inclusive and democratic societies and is critical to country and regional stability.” For policies to work, institutions to function, and security to last, diverse perspectives must be included.\n",
      "Until the gender data gap is narrowed, the lack of data, and the underrepresentation of women that feeds and is fed by it, will continue to limit the effectiveness of private, public, and non-profit organizations. But the gender data gap will not close on its own—we must actively seek to close it, the sooner the better.

PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that worldwide, AI will “increase global GDP by $15.7 trillion, a full 14%, by 2030.” But of this, $7 trillion is likely to accrue to China, $3.7 trillion to North America, and only $957 billion to India.[6]\n",

Home-grown efforts on the academic, business, and investor fronts are few.”[8] Seventy percent of the AI research in the nation occurs in non-Indian firms. As an illustration, in looking at research publications, 62 percent of it comes from Google and IBM employees working in India and “there is only one Indian company in the top 10.”[9]\n",
      "There is growing AI interest, however, as India starts to invest additional resources and deploy new AI applications. This year, the national government has doubled its investment in its innovation program known as Digital India to Rs3,063 crore (or $477 million) in order to fund advances in AI, machine learning, and 3-D printing.[10] The Ministry of Commerce and Industry has developed an AI Taskforce to develop policies that encourage innovation in these areas. Its recent report emphasized the need for greater investment, more AI research, revamping of school curricula, and additional innovation by the private sector.[11]\n",

Beyond diagnosis and treatment, AI techniques and ML algorithms can also fine-tune interventions in public health policy across the country. There are large variations in the disease burden and demand for care across states of India, as well as across districts within large states such as Uttar Pradesh. The government can design real-time health interventions targeting specific populations, which is critically needed in Indian health policy.\n",

      "AI offers the hope of improving supply chain management and resource utilization. Both of these factors are vital for manufacturing and movement up the value chain. Factories and warehouses have difficulty managing logistics and forecasting the need for particular products. Software can help track supplies and make sure companies have what they need to make their products.[14] This is particularly important given the long term strategic role of the manufacturing sector for job creation and raising overall productivity in the economy.\n",
      "Crime Prediction\n",
      "Indian authorities are using AI developed abroad to anticipate crime and intervene before it happens. For example, an Israeli company called Cortica is working with the Best Group “to analyze the terabytes of data streaming from CCTV cameras in public areas. One of the goals is to improve safety in public places, such as city streets, bus stops, and train stations.” The firm is “looking for ‘behavioral anomalies’’ that signal someone is about to commit a violent crime.”[15] Given the various security risks that India faces, application of AI and ML can be instrumental in maintaining law and order as well as neutralizing extremist threats across states of the country.\n",
      "Precision Agriculture\n",
      "Farmers are seeking to deploy AI to increase crop yields. Using sensors that measure soil temperature and moisture, these software systems identify the ideal time for planting and harvesting, and help farmers make efficient use of pest control and fertilization. Suhas Wani, Director of the International Crop Research Institute notes “sowing date as such is very critical to ensure that farmers harvest a good crop. And if it fails, it results in loss as a lot of costs are incurred for seeds, as well as the fertilizer applications.”[16] The usage of AI is also potentially significant in weather insurance, where accurate estimates of local weather conditions are instrumental in designing insurance policies for agriculture and other industries.\n",
      "Based on these examples, it is clear India needs to encourage greater AI investment, see more support from government agencies, make it possible for private firms to develop novel applications, reform education programs in order to generate better AI training, and encourage the venture capital community to invest in India. Adoption of these actions would help India expand its GDP and build greater economic prosperity in the future.\n",

      "Some policymakers are taking such thinking to heart. Senator John Kennedy (R-LA) introduced a three-page bill, the “Own Your Own Data Act of 2019,” which declares that “each individual owns and has an exclusive property right in the data that individual generates on the internet” and requires that social media companies obtain licenses to use this data. Senators Mark Warner (D-VA) and Josh Hawley (R-MO) are filing legislation to require Facebook, Google, and other large collectors of data to disclose the value of personal data they collect, although the bill would not require payments. In California, Governor Gavin Newsome wants to pursue a “data dividend” designed to “share in the wealth that is created from [people’s] data.”\n",
      "Treating our data as our property has understandable appeal. It touches what the foundational privacy thinker Alan Westin identified as an essential aspect of privacy, a right “to control, edit, manage, and delete information about [individuals] and decide when, how, and to what extent information is communicated to others.” It expresses the unfairness people feel about an asymmetrical marketplace in which we know little about the data we share but the companies that receive the data can profit by extracting marketable information.\n",
      "The trouble is, it’s not your data; it’s not their data either.  Treating data like it is property fails to recognize either the value that varieties of personal information serve or the abiding interest that individuals have in their personal information even if they choose to “sell” it. Data is not a commodity. It is information. Any system of information rights—whether patents, copyrights, and other intellectual property, or privacy rights—presents some tension with strong interest in the free flow of information that is reflected by the First Amendment. Our personal information is in demand precisely because it has value to others and to society across a myriad of uses.\n",
      "Treating personal information as property to be licensed or sold may induce people to trade away their privacy rights for very little value while injecting enormous friction into free flow of information. The better way to strengthen privacy is to ensure that individual privacy interests are respected as personal information flows to desirable uses, not to reduce personal data to a commodity.\n",
      "Intersecting interests in personal information\n",
      "To unpack the private and public interests inherent in personal information, consider the simple case of your name. It is a fundamental part of individual identity, and it is the first item on any list of “personally identifiable information” protected by privacy rules. We each have vital interest in our names and the assets and identities we link to them.\n",
      "But this interest is not exclusive. Our names are also a way that others recognize us, associated by friends and family with who and what we are, and used by society for voting rolls, property registries, financial accounts, and countless other social, economic, and civic contexts. This makes our names essential social and economic currency that is valuable to others.\n",
      "It is because of this social and economic significance that naming is regulated. We are assigned names at birth, registered on birth certificates. It takes official approval to change these names. In this way, as personal as our identities are to us, they are also instruments of a well-functioning society.\n",
      "Other personal information that we necessarily share alongside our names also involves intersecting interests. The transactions we conduct through a bank become part of the business records of the bank, as the Supreme Court recognized in United States v. Miller. But the bank’s interest in these records does not necessarily mean it has absolute control to do what it wants with this information, as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley financial privacy law makes explicit. Courts have relied on Miller to conclude that records of your cell phone calls and other business records can be obtained from the parties that hold these records.\n",
      "In Carpenter v. United States last year, however, the Court required a warrant for cell phone location data that service providers retain for their use. Although not overturning Miller, the Court also recognized that that the phone users retain expectations of privacy in location data generated from their phones. The same intersecting interests apply to much of the other information we share as we interact with digital services—e-commerce transactions, mobile applications, messaging services and other communications, and pictures or information we share on our social networks among others.\n",
      "Of course, much of the data we generate is shared more widely than just with recipients like these, but here too the interests in information from the data are not exclusive. The digital economy operates in broad ecosystems of data-sharing for diverse uses. Well-accepted examples are for credit reporting; bank clearing and compliance with know-your-customer rules; fraud monitoring; and security. Many of these functions are recognized explicitly in laws and standards—from the first federal privacy law in 1970, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, to the recent European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act—while others are invisible. Few sectors exist entirely outside such ecosystems. And as businesses outsource functions and move their data processing onto cloud services and remote sensing of all kinds begins to deploy across environments, an increasing amount of personal data is in the custody of entities unknown to us as consumers.\n",

      "The most visible and debated of these ecosystems are in advertising and marketing. They are controversial both because the visibility to consumers makes them aware of tracking and data-sharing but also because mechanisms of ad-tech like advertising identifiers and cookies enable tracking across sites and devices, sharing information without our knowledge and sometimes even despite measures we take to avoid such tracking and sharing. In turn, data brokers aggregate and supplement much of this tracking information with other data derived from apps, social media, and public databases. As intrusive as such collection and uses can be, regulation must take into account First Amendment protection, which extends in some measure to advertising, and must recognize for better or worse that advertising supports a wide range of socially useful products and services, including vital news media and other content providers.\n",
      "In short, a significant amount of data sharing serves important public interests and values. The friction and disruption from any system of payments for data would undermine these interests and values. Yet, these costs would come with little benefit for individual privacy.\n",
      "Instead, what is needed is to enable the sharing personal information that is useful for our social, economic, and governmental systems while protecting the vital interests that each of us has in our personal information. It is precisely to these ends that we need to move away from our current transactional approach to privacy\n",
      "The handling of personal information in medical research and other research involving human subjects, detection of disparate impacts and analysis to identify discrimination, and the U.S. census provide examples where sharing of information provides important benefits for society. Most medical research is subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability of 1996 and the Privacy Rule adopted by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that defines numerous categories of personal information and limits how these can be disclosed and shared. Human subject research comes under HHS “Common Rule” that provides for institutional review boards to evaluate the risks to subjects, including their privacy, and how to address these risks.\n",
      "The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission requires employers to report data that includes gender and race or ethnicity. Without data as to race and other protected categories, discrimination is impossible to detect. Census data is considered important enough that we compel people to respond, but the law also limits the use of this data to statistical use, a limit so deeply embedded that anyone who handles the data must swear an oath to observe the limit, violation of which is a criminal offense. Consistent with these privacy obligations, the release of census data is vetted mathematically to avoid release of information at levels granular enough to associate data with individuals.\n",
      "In turn, census data provides a foundation for social science research of every kind, informing government policy at every level, academic research, and business planning and market research.  The census documentation of the U.S. population and society is available for free — an information commons created by public policy. It works fairly and consistently with our values because public policy also protects a baseline of protection for individual privacy interests. Baseline privacy requirements for how companies protect individual privacy can do the same in the commercial arena.\n",
      "Why property rights in data will not protect individuals effectively\n",
      "Basing privacy protection on property systems, on the other hand, would reduce privacy to a commodity, double down on a transactional model based on consumer choice, and be enormously complicated to implement. The current notice-and-choice model is failing because it is effectively impossible for users to understand either how their data will be used or the accompanying privacy risks, especially in the constant flow of online engagement in today’s connected world. The result is that people click past privacy notices through to the information or service they want.\n",
      "Moreover, many of these consumers already agree to provide personal information in exchange for the perception a benefit. It is hard to imagine people will burrow deeper into privacy disclosures or pause at clicking through to get at communications or transactions simply because they are offered what may amount to a few pennies.  It is far from clear that in a market for data, the ordinary user would come out on top—either in relation to economic benefits or privacy harms. On the contrary, by licensing the use of their information in exchange for monetary consideration, they may be worse off than under the current notice-and-choice regime.\n",
      "Indeed, the uncertainties of valuating any one individual’s data suggest that individuals will receive little payment. Estimates vary but The Financial Times has a calculator that one of us (Kerry) ran for his profile. The default value is $0.007, but as a well-to-do professional who travels a lot, the value of the Kerry data was estimated as $1.78. If pricing is set by service providers, then the resulting system is likely to end up being very similar to the current “take it or leave it” outcomes that are common under notice and choice. If pricing is set by consumers or through negotiation, the complexity of the service-user interactions would be even greater. And this new complexity would likely slow users’ access to information and services that they want—and simply turn “click fatigue” into “negotiation fatigue.”\n",

      "If pricing is set by regulators or a legislature, this could require drawing of lines about the use of information based on judgments that some should be favored and others disfavored (e.g., different pricing for medical research versus commercial data brokerage). Yet this approach might risk an adverse review under the Supreme Court’s First Amendment holding in Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., which rejected a Vermont limitation on a few particular uses of information about a pharmacy prescription transaction. Although the Sorrell case turned on particular decisions and statements made by the Vermont legislature, any privacy legislation is likely to face challenges under the First Amendment commercial speech doctrine, which encompasses commercial advertising within free speech protection on the basis of a “strong interest in the free flow of commercial information” on the part of both consumers and society. It is far from clear that a property rights approach to privacy would improve the arguments needed to withstand a constitutional challenge on such grounds.\n",
      "A property-based system also disregards interests besides property that individuals have in personal information. Consumers often benefit from freely providing information for use in a particular context, but they can suffer a range of privacy harms if the information is used in an unrelated context not contemplated when use of the information was licensed. At the same, imbuing property rights in personal information would affect sharing of data in many common contexts. In a simple purchase of a book from an online retailer, for example, the book title and subject could reveal highly personal information about the purchaser, but the retailer surely would have a right to retain and use its own business records about the transaction (including the title of the book).\n",
      "Under an information-as-property regime, would both the purchaser and the retailer have property rights to information about the transaction? And in such a property regime, couldn’t the retailer simply make as a condition of sale that the purchaser must grant a license to the retailer to use the information for specified uses? And wouldn’t that simply lead to another form of the tyranny of fine print in which the purchaser who wants the convenience of an online purchase would be forced to cede rights to the retailer? It is unclear whether the information as property regime would in fact improve the current state of privacy.\n",
      "Looking beyond this retail scenario, how would information-as-property apply to a simple online conversation between two individuals who exchange personal information with each other—perhaps even information about personal activities that the two individuals did together? Would both individuals have property interests in the personal information about a joint activity? Would that mean that neither individual could tell anyone else about the joint activity without the permission of the other individual? (Facebook allows users to delete or port their own photographs but not other people’s photos in which they are tagged).\n",
      "The European Union’s GDPR provides a benchmark for the complexity of introducing property interests into information ecosystems. The regulation required an enormous amount of systems design work to map data flows within organizations, document these for regulators, change user interfaces, and create the back-end systems to enable individual access, correction, and deletion. Microsoft revealed that it put 1,600 engineers on the task implementing the GDPR. Creating a system of micropayments similarly would add major new layers to user interfaces and back-ends systems.\n",
      "There are apps and proposals that seek to protect privacy through intermediaries. MIT’s big data pioneer Alexander Pentland and Thomas Hardjono have proposed that credit unions and labor unions could use their collective role to operate data cooperatives on behalf of their members, negotiating and managing permissions as well as deriving insights for their users. In a similar vein, CitizenMe is developing a data “exchange” that enables individuals to pool their data for surveys and other uses in exchange for compensation, and also to receive develop analysis of their data. In time, a privacy marketplace may develop platforms like these. In the meantime, the challenges of implementation, adoption, and permissions management across many different contexts and interests in information means these are not a substitute for widely applicable baseline privacy legislation.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "Alan Westin’s insight about control has a place of honor in the constellation of individual interests that make up what we call privacy. But it should not be taken literally as the entirety, it cannot be exclusive, and it is not enough to protect interests that persist in personal information even after we share it with others.\n",
      "Privacy legislation should empower individuals through more layered and meaningful transparency and individual rights to know, correct, and delete personal information in databases held by others. But relying entirely on individual control will not do enough to change a system that is failing individuals, and trying to reinforce control with a property interest is likely to fail society as well. Rather than trying to resolve whether personal information belongs to individuals or to the companies that collect it, a baseline federal privacy law should directly protect the abiding interest that individuals have in that information and also enable the social benefits that flow from sharing information.\n",

In the near future, routine doctor’s visits may be replaced by regularly monitoring one’s health status and remote consultations. The inpatient setting will be improved by more sophisticated quality metrics drawn from an ecosystem of interconnected digital health tools. The care patients receive may be decided in consultation with decision support software that is informed not only by expert judgments but also by algorithms that draw on information from patients around the world, some of whom will differ from the “typical” patient. Support may be customized for an individual’s personal genetic information, and doctors and nurses will be skilled interpreters of advanced ways to diagnose, track, and treat illnesses. In a number of different ways, policymakers are likely to have new tools that provide valuable insights into complicated health, treatment, and spending trends.\n",

      "However, recent developments in data analytics also suggest barriers to change that might be more substantial in the health care field than in other parts of the economy. Despite the immense promise of health analytics, the industry lags behind other major sectors in taking advantage of cutting-edge tools. Most health care organizations, for example, have yet to devise a clear approach for integrating data analytics into their regular operations. One study even showed that 56 percent of hospitals have no strategies for data governance or analytics.\n",
      "Compared to other industries, the slow pace of innovation reflects challenges that are unique to health care in implementing and applying “big data” tools. These barriers include the nature of health care decisions, problematic data conventions, institutionalized practices in care delivery, and the misaligned incentives of various actors in the industry. To address these barriers, federal policy should emphasize interoperability of health data and prioritize payment reforms that will encourage providers to develop data analytics capabilities.\n",

      "Sensitivity of care decisions\n",
      "A major barrier to the widespread application of data analytics in health care is the nature of the decisions and the data themselves. Unlike many other industries, health care decisions deal with hugely sensitive information, require timely information and action, and sometimes have life or death consequences. Each of these features creates a barrier to the pervasive use of data analytics.\n",
      "The immediacy of health care decisions requires regular monitoring of data and extensive staffing and infrastructure to collect and tabulate information. The nature of health care decisions are more immediate and intrinsic than those made in other settings, creating a hesitancy about overhauling any major aspect of care provision. Health care decisions must take into account patient preferences, which at times differ from expert recommendations.\n",

      "The importance and complexity of these decisions means physicians and patients insist on very high standards for data-analytics tools in health care. That has proven very challenging to designers of these tools, as health providers are more accustomed to dealing with either broad knowledge or narrow choices rather than complex predictions that require careful identification of decisions and calibration of predictions. As a result, clinical decision support software has struggled to make better insights than physicians. Even one of the most advanced systems, IBM’s Watson, made a series of “unsafe and incorrect treatment recommendations” because it was calibrated based on synthetic cases rather than real patient data. There is risk even when training software uses real patient data because decision support software may overfit its models and thereby make less useful suggestions, such as prescribing an inappropriate treatment plan. Sometimes, the clinically best medical decision is not always what a patient wants to pursue.\n",
      "The sensitive nature of health care decisions and data furthermore creates major concerns about privacy. Patients are rightfully concerned about the security of their data and concerned about it being used in ways that are detrimental to them, damage their reputations, or disadvantage them in the rating and marketing decisions of insurers. This isn’t limited to medical record data. Recent news coverage of the capture of the Golden State Killer, for example, has raised new questions about the privacy of direct-to-consumer genetic testing. And while the growth of “wearables” such as FitBit and Nike+ FuelBand have made health status monitoring accessible to patients, these data are not subjected to federal patient privacy laws, allowing these companies to design their own internal privacy policies and share information with third-parties.\n",
      "Problematic data conventions\n",
      "Several data conventions in health care hinder the widespread use of data analytics. Currently, health care data are split among different entities and have different formats such that building an insightful, granular database is next to impossible. These qualities greatly increase the cost of using data to provide value, even when all the relevant information has been recorded in some form. Furthermore, even well-structured data are often not available to researchers or providers who could use them in useful ways.\n",
      "Several data conventions in health care hinder the widespread use of data analytics. Currently, health care data are split among different entities and have different formats such that building an insightful, granular database is next to impossible.\n",
      "In general, the health care industry has been resistant to making information available as open data commons, which are up-to-date data provided in accessible format and available to all. That resistance comes in part from fear of violating privacy, even though existing strategies for protecting confidentiality greatly mitigate that risk. A larger reason is that data commons are a public good and will naturally be undersupplied by the market. A third data challenge is data quality. For analysis or predictions to have any value, they must be based on good data. One of the most hyped applications of big data in epidemiology, Google Flu Trends, turned out to underperform far more basic models, despite analyzing far more data, because its analysts were extrapolating from the behavior of Google users—an unrepresentative group of people. The experience illustrated that the success of data analytics in health care is dependent upon the availability and utilization of quality data.\n",
      "Institutional practices\n",
      "Entrenched practices in the delivery of health care also create several barriers to the full adoption of data analytics. One clear illustration of the challenge is in one of the most promising areas of data analytics: clinical decision support. While data analytics could greatly improve the clinical decision-making process, the development of decision support tools hasn’t paid sufficient attention to how decisions are actually made and the related workflows supporting those decisions. The tools often assume that putting the right information on a single person’s dashboard can induce them to make the right decision, but in reality, most difficult clinical decisions involve many actors and often follow institutional guidelines designed by committees. Data tools that do not fit into existing work and decision-making structures add burdens to physicians and are much less effective than they could be. For example, many attempts to bring data analytics or other information technology into health care have created a large data entry burden for physicians. This had led to high-profile mistakes, physician burnout, and general dissatisfaction with the tools.\n",
      "As a consequence, most of the major reasons physicians cite for their resistance to adoption of new data tools are related to workflow disruption. For data analytics to truly transform care, the designers of tools need to cognizant of the context their tools will be used in and health care organizations must be willing to reorganize some elements of their practice to empower patients and providers to use data-driven care.\n",
      "Misaligned incentives\n",
      "Arguably the largest barrier to the implementation and application of data analytics in health care is the splintered landscape of the industry, with separate components having their own incentives that diverge from what might be best for the entire system. At the moment, physicians or delivery systems may not know that their patients have visited emergency rooms, for example, unless told by the insurer—because claims data are held by the payer. Meanwhile, care providers may hold clinical data that could help insurers better manage their patient’s costs. The responsibility for managing any given patient is split between their insurer and various providers, each with different incentives and needs and neither functioning as an ideal agent for the patient.\n",
      "Insurers have incentives to invest in better health for their covered population, but these incentives are mitigated by annual contracts with employers or individuals and employee turnover, which moves many enrollees to a different insurer before the payer’s investments in their health pay off. There are also serious concerns with expecting insurers to take the lead on data analytics in health care. First, data tools designed for insurers are likely to center on costs, which may leave some quality-enhancing insights unexplored. Second, insurer data analytics may impose an externality on hospitals and physicians, which have to bear the administrative costs of complying with the data practices of various insurers. Third, insurers may not conduct their data analytics on a clinically useful timetable. Unless they feed data to providers continuously, it may not be timely enough to affect how patients receive care. The limited degree to which insurers provide claims data to providers that they contract with may reflect the expense of doing so, limitations in their legacy IT systems, or a desire to retain more of the care management responsibility.\n",
      "The responsibility for managing any given patient is split between their insurer and various providers, each with different incentives and needs and neither functioning as an ideal agent for the patient.\n",
      "Health care providers have their own particular incentives. Under the most common payment schemes, providers typically have little incentive to control patient costs. However, they likely do care about quality of care, even if they are hesitant to change their institutional practices and norms. Despite seeming like a more logical locus for data decisions, hospitals are often unwilling to undertake the costs of developing data capabilities or the disruption of implementing their use into regular practice. Hospitals also have an incentive to slow health information exchange standards because the lack of interoperability binds physicians into referral patterns favorable to them. Similarly, vendors of health information technology often don’t want standardization of data tools and practices because differentiation of their products and high costs for providers that switch vendors create substantial monopoly power for vendors. Finally, patients themselves often don’t support data practices that can improve care for all. The fear of data breaches or misuse leads patients to oppose data sharing arrangements that may have widespread positive externalities. In short, no individual actor in the health care space has the incentives or means to fully embrace the most revolutionary data analytics practices.\n",
      "Policy recommendations\n",
      "Because of the systemic challenges described above, we need policy changes that diminish the barriers to health analytics. While there is potential for radical overhaul, the initial priority should be making sure all hospitals can record, use, and share patient data in useful ways. One critical component of that agenda is ensuring interoperability of Electronic Medical Records (EMRs). Federal policy has contributed a great deal to the adoption of EMRs and other health IT practices through incentives under the Medicare program, but providers still struggle with sharing that data. As discussed above, neither hospitals nor EMR vendors have a strong incentive to standardize health information exchanges, despite the fact that interoperable EMRs can improve care and save money. The 2009 Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act included health information exchange as one of the required capabilities for certified EMR systems. However, this requirement was included at a later implementation stage, allowing EMR systems to be designed and integrated into health systems without these capabilities, making interoperability even more difficult. In 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act increased incentives and penalties specifically promoting EMR interoperability.\n",
      "These incentives need not aim to establish one universal EMR. Applications that can access and transfer health data from different kinds of EMRs can achieve interoperability, but they are not used as widely or thoroughly as possible, risking a situation where the applications meant to bridge different EMRs themselves fail to adopt uniform data conventions. Federal policy could standardize the way EMR data are accessed and transferred by applications, like Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), that exist to facilitate interoperability. It could also revise HITECH and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to allow fees for data exchange, thus creating incentives to improve data exchange that could potentially counteract the existing disincentives. Federal support for best practices in data management and use would go a long way in helping the industry develop its own capabilities.\n",
      "The federal government can also indirectly support the development of health data analytics by continuing to encourage payment based on the value of care, typically through the Medicare program, encouraging alternative payment approaches, and by working to align quality measures and payment approaches with private insurers. Under value-based care models, providers are typically paid some amount per beneficiary based on the package of care they are expected to deliver, with payment at least partially tied to quality-of-care metrics. These models aim to create the incentive for providers to provide high-quality care at lower costs, which often involves closer coordination of care and careful revision of many practices. All these features make hospitals operating under value-based care models better loci for data-backed decisions. Kaiser Permanente has demonstrated the power of a well-integrated data strategy aimed at managing costs and quality. Conversely, improved data analytics capabilities may be precisely what health care providers need to better coordinate and improve value of care. Medicare could improve the usability of its data for a wider audience with a varying degree of analytic capabilities to help more of these providers successfully implement these new health care models. Coupling these systemic health care reforms can allow them to complement each other and reduce administrative confusion.\n",
      "Federal support for best practices in data management and use would go a long way in helping the industry develop its own capabilities.\n",
      "One factor that is holding back progress toward value-based payment is risk adjustment—varying the payment on the basis of how challenging one provider’s patients are in comparison to other providers. Much of the energy in improving risk adjustment has focused on contracts between purchasers and insurers—for example, between the Medicare program and Medicare Advantage plans. But the risk adjustment challenges for contracts between insurers and providers are distinct from these and, if ignored, pose grave challenges to some of the best providers, who inevitably attract patients with the most challenging conditions.\n",
      "Despite the disruptions to conventional practices, all actors in health care should be excited about the possibilities that new data tools will bring. But obtaining this enormous potential is not around the corner and will require overcoming challenges by all of the relevant components of the health care system.\n",

      "The definitive work on emerging technology and insurgency has yet to be written, but two recent books offer suggestions for how the era of big data and AI will affect the United States’ modern conflicts. Small Wars, Big Data: The Information Revolution in Modern Conflict, by Eli Berman, Joseph Felter, and Jacob Shapiro, offers few musings about the future of insurgency, but lays out a compelling theory about the ways in which information shapes insurgent violence. By contrast, Paul Scharre’s excellent new book, Army of None: Autonomous Weapons and the Future of War, offers little in the way of counterinsurgency strategy, but is wholly concerned with how artificial intelligence will reshape armed conflict. Taken together, they begin to sketch out a vision for how AI and big data might alter insurgent dynamics.\n",
      "The core insight of Small Wars, Big Data is that insurgencies are ultimately competitions over information rather than territory or ideology. Since insurgents can readily blend in with their surrounding populations, regime forces cannot defeat an insurgency unless the local population identifies who and where the insurgents are. The challenge for the state is thus to convince local civilians to provide that information, while the challenge for insurgents is to persuade them not to. In Berman, Felter, and Shapiro’s telling, just about everything that happens in an insurgency—from building schools and hospitals on the one hand, to the indiscriminate slaughter of civilians on the other—can be read as an attempt to coax or intimidate civilians into divulging or withholding what they know.\n",
      "Small Wars, Big Data is by no means the first to offer that argument. But it is unique in terms of the breadth and depth of the empirical evidence it marshals. From the pioneering research of Stathis Kalyvas in the early 2000s on, political scientists from Lisa Hultman to Laia Balcells have compiled an extraordinary body of empirical work on the “micro-foundations” of insurgent and civil war violence. As leading contributors to that literature themselves, the authors do an admirable job of surveying its findings.\n",
      "Of particular note is chapter four, which offers a thorough overview of the debate regarding the effects of developments in information technology on insurgent violence. As the authors note, on the one hand, information technology may reduce insurgent attacks by making it easier for states to gather intelligence about the insurgents. On the other, it may instead increase attacks by enabling insurgents to better coordinate with one another. By comparing the rollout of cell phone networks with insurgent violence in Iraq, the authors show that cell phones—by offering low cost, anonymous ways of supplying information about insurgents at little risk to the informant—do appear to reduce and disrupt insurgent activity. That the Taliban in Afghanistan and Boko Haram in Nigeria have both repeatedly targeted cell phone towers, despite the improved communication they enable, suggests that even insurgents themselves fear that information technology has tilted the balance of power to the state.\n",
      "For all its strengths, Small Wars, Big Data is not without its flaws. One is that it gives short shrift to the kind of “brute force” tactics that Jacqueline Hazelton discussed in a controversial article last summer. The book would have been stronger if it had discussed at greater length why exploiting information technology is more effective at defeating insurgencies than draconian policies like mass incarceration, mass resettlement, or even mass killing. But the other critique is that the book’s title hints at a topic it never addresses: It is primarily a book about the role of information in insurgency, rather than information technology. The title makes for great marketing, but it’s a bit of misnomer.\n",

      "Army of None, by contrast, more than lives up to its billing. Scharre has spent nearly a decade framing the early debate over autonomous weapons in D.C. and the Pentagon, and the experience shows. The book plainly and masterfully lays out the major questions that AI and autonomous weapons raise for the future of armed conflict. Although written for a popular audience, even well-informed academics will find it worthwhile as an introduction to the technical, ethical, and strategic issues that AI-infused weapons systems will introduce.\n",
      "Scharre’s argument about the coming ubiquity of big data and AI has profound implications for the future of insurgency. Very roughly, two futures are possible. In one, AI and autonomous weapons are both distributed and commoditized, such that insurgents can afford weapons systems that are nearly as capable as those of any given regime. Think of the commercial off-the-shelf drones that the Islamic State has deployed in Iraq and Syria, but with low-level intelligence and object-detection baked in via Tensorflow. Since many of the cutting-edge AI projects are open source and publicly available, it may well be possible to build makeshift lethal autonomous weapons systems that are nearly as good as state-of-the-art systems but at a fraction of the cost. In such a scenario, the balance may shift slightly to insurgents; one shudders to imagine the carnage a Mumbai-style attack could produce if the attackers had lethal drone swarms at their disposal.\n",
      "However, if the future of artificial intelligence is one that favors scale and centralization, then AI may give the upper hand to regime forces. In this world, regimes with access to the products and infrastructure of a great power, like the United States or China, may rapidly unravel insurgent networks. We might think of this as the “wars of none” scenario, since the regime’s overwhelming informational advantage may come to limit the need for violence altogether.\n",

      "Recall that the central point of Small Wars, Big Data is that insurgencies are primarily contests for information about the identity and location of insurgents, and that even relatively simple technology—such as a text-based tipline—appears to make it much easier for states to gain that information. What happens when tiplines are replaced with real-time surveillance systems equipped with facial recognition? As the cost of ubiquitous surveillance drops, we may see the emergence of a new counterinsurgency strategy: Whereas the “hearts-and-minds” approach tries to coax information out of civilians and the “brute force” approach attempts to coerce it, the “big brother” approach may bypass civilians altogether. There’s little need for informants if you have enough sensors, cameras, and processing power to recognize and track everyone, everywhere.\n",
      "Although such a scenario may seem far-fetched, early versions are already feasible. In the United States, Anduril Industries, the latest security startup funded by Peter Thiel, is fast at work building an “electronic” wall that has already proven remarkably effective at detecting and monitoring unauthorized border crossings in Texas. In China, meanwhile, authorities have responded to deadly attacks in Xinjiang by widely deploying facial recognition and mass surveillance technology there. And the capabilities of Chinese authorities are only set to grow: Beijing recently announced a massive new investment in SenseTime, an AI startup whose next generation product aims to identify objects and individuals across 100,000 live camera feeds simultaneously.\n",
      "Whether AI and information technology will empower states or insurgents remains unclear. Most likely it will do both, with AI and information technology supercharging insurgencies in failing or weak countries while constraining the space in which insurgency can occur everywhere else. What seems certain is that the information revolution is poised to revolutionize insurgency soon too.\n",

      "The global growth of microfinance banks has created new opportunities for financial inclusion, with outstanding lending of $100 billion to around 200 million clients. Yet the majority of lending from microfinance institutions has been to urban populations and not to the rural poor or small farmers.\n",
      "Farmers with access to finance can invest in fertilizers and seeds to increase their yields and incomes potentially by more than 25 percent.\n",
      "There are well known reasons that make lending money to farmers so hard. Farmers are spread out across large thinly populated areas making them costly to reach and serve; they have few realizable assets to pledge as collateral against loans; and they generally have no financial history, which is needed for credit scoring. And on top of all that, agriculture is regarded as a risky business, often at the mercy of the weather. Yet farmers with access to finance can invest in fertilizers and seeds to increase their yields and incomes potentially by more than 25 percent.\n",
      "New technologies have the potential to give farmers access to the financial tools necessary for such growth.\n",
      "The rise of mobile phones in rural areas has been dramatic with over 90 percent of Africans able to access cellphone services, and many farmers now use cellphones to make calls, send text messages, and access data and informational services. The adoption of mobile money services has mirrored cellphone growth, allowing users to send and receive funds using a network of local agents.\n",

      "\n",
      "Source: Chart adapted from “The Mobile Economy Sub-Saharan Africa 2017”\n",
      "Big data analytics for credit risk assessment has been on the rise across urban areas of developing countries over the past years. Several startups offer loans to previously un-bankable customers using cellphone data (call data records, mobile money data, and social media data). This data is processed by algorithms, generating a predictive score of a person’s likelihood to repay a loan.\n",
      "Crop suitability mapping enables lenders to understand how risky a farmers production is, based on where they are located (using geo-mapping techniques, lenders are able to ensure that they only lend to a farmer growing a suitable crop in a suitable location).\n",
      "Can this new technology really make farmers bankable?\n",
      "Imagine a poor farmer in Ghana that has been growing beans to sell into the local market. After providing for her family, she doesn’t have enough money left over to purchase high quality seeds or fertilizers, even though such inputs would increase the amount of beans she will grow. She tried borrowing from the local microfinance bank, but since she had never saved with them before, they are not willing to grant her a loan. Suddenly she receives a text message asking if she’d like to apply for a loan to pay for inputs. She clicks “yes,” and receives an automated message saying she has received the loan. The loan automatically goes into her mobile money account, and she visits the supply store to purchase seeds and fertilizers. Next harvest she produces 30 percent more beans than usual. After selling her crops she visits the local mobile money agent to repay the loan and interest. As a result, she is left with more money than normal, so she joins the local microfinance bank to open a savings account with the surplus funds. Now, she is an individual with a bank account opening further opportunities for her and her family.\n",
      "The story above is not yet happening but is a distinct possibility and illustrates how technology can transform a farmer into a profitable borrower. While cellphone-based lending is starting to happen in Africa, with products such as MShwari in Kenya, this type of lending so far has been mainly for small, short-term loans for urban customers. Farmers who are less tech-savvy and need larger, longer-term loans repayable at the end of the season cannot benefit from existing mobile loan services. Yet by transforming the application process into a simple automated cellphone-based application, transaction costs plummet and remote farmers can access the service. By using cellphone records for credit scores, previously “un-scorable” customers are now ratable. Using agronomic geospatial data ensures that lending is only given to farmers growing the right crops in the right location. Migrating cash management to mobile money platforms dramatically reduces money disbursement and recovery costs. The mix of these technologies could grant access to seasonal lending to smallholder farmers.\n",
      "Perhaps the nearest example of this technological convergence to date is Safaricom’s DigiFarm and Connected Farmer model in Kenya. The platform offers a range of services to farmers including e-vouchers for quality inputs at discounted prices; access to agriculture advice services via a training module; and advice on how to appropriately use inputs like seed and fertilizer. Digifarm also offers farmers the opportunity to apply, via their cellphones, for a loan to be used to purchase agricultural inputs, although data on total lending and repayment rates is not yet available. The loan module appears to build upon their proven success with the M-Shwari mobile microloan available to Sarfaricom customers.\n",
      "If Digifarm and other similar services achieve success, we are likely to see many other mobile companies, banks, and startups replicate their models.  Most exciting of all is the impact that this will have on farmers who will have increased opportunities to invest in their endeavors.\n",

      "Learning progressions have been described as roadmaps that help align curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment. These roadmaps point out important locations on the typical journey from novice to expert by describing what someone at each important location on the roadmap knows and can do. The descriptions highlight what is unique about each location, ensuring that differences between locations are emphasized so the transformations in skills and knowledge along the learning journey can be recognized. By mapping the journey, learning progressions help ensure the curriculum developers, teachers, and assessment designers are all working with the same destination in mind.\n",

      "Different types of curriculum design require learning progressions of different grain sizes. When developing multi-year curricula, designers require coarse-grained learning progressions which describe learning over a long time period. An example from the USA illustrates how levels on a learning progression in science can be mapped to two or three grades each so the curriculum can be designed accordingly. This approach provides the opportunity to design evidence-based curricula which mirror the typical patterns of development for learners across grades because the learning progressions are founded on research.\n",
      "In the Philippines, we have applied this approach through fine-grained learning progressions that are being used to monitor student progress through the new science curriculum for Grades 7-10. The curriculum presents increasing levels of complexity from one grade to another in an upward spiraling progression, to develop deep understandings of core science concepts and skills. This provides the opportunity to construct tests that reflect this progression, and the test results can be used in multiple ways.\n",
      "We wanted to know whether students entering a grade had the pre-requisite knowledge, skills, and understanding needed to be able to engage successfully with the science chemistry curriculum at that grade level. To develop the tests used in this research, and with the support of the Philippines Department of Education, the Assessment Curriculum and Technology Research Centre (ACTRC) collaborated with colleagues from University of the Philippines National Institute for Science and Mathematics Education Development (UP NISMED), University of Philippines College of Education, and its Integrated School to audit the curriculum and identify the prerequisite conceptual knowledge and skills that are necessary for students to engage with the chemistry content in each of Grades 7-10. Using the audit information, test items were written to assess mastery of the identified concepts and skills.\n",
      "As students entered into each of the grade levels, they took the grade-appropriate test, which provided information about their readiness to engage with the curriculum. The results, aligned with the progressions, captured the levels of proficiency of students within each successive grade. Some students were still at early locations along the learning journey, while others had progressed further and employed more sophisticated chemical thinking. The levels on each learning progression were then compared to the pre-requisite skills and knowledge expected by the grade level curriculum and the percentage of students who are ready (and not ready) for the curriculum content were calculated.\n",

From the expert identification of what level of skill is required to enable students to engage successfully with the Grade 8 chemistry curriculum, students in Level C and above were found to be ready for the Grade 8 curriculum, while students in Level B and below were found to be unready. The differences between the knowledge and skills at Level B and Level C included the crucial distinction between representations of matter where differences can be seen by the naked eye and representations of matter where differences cannot be seen even with a microscope and must be understood conceptually.

      "Our starting point with the scaling labs is to learn more about how effective education interventions expand and deepen their impact—what we refer to as scale—especially among some of the world’s most marginalized communities. The global education community is learning a lot about how best to scale, some of which is seen in our 2016 report Millions Learning: Scaling Up Quality Education in Developing Countries. But there is certainly a lot more to learn, particularly around the core drivers behind adapting an evidenced-based initiative to a new context as well as about the enabling conditions in the environment that allow for good ideas to take root and spread. Through the lab process, we hope to learn even more about this scaling as it unfolds in real-time.\n",
      "Secondly, we hope to document this process so that we gain deeper insight into the scaling journey, not only to understand what outcomes are achieved but, just as importantly, to understand how they are achieved, and to be able to “tell the story of what happened” so that other decisionmakers can learn from it. We are thinking a lot about how best to capture and share this insight in an actionable way to help inform future policy, financing, and programmatic decisions around scaling in education.\n",
      "And the final leg of the stool is helping to support scaling efforts at the center of the Real-time Scaling Labs. Rather than merely learning from and documenting what is happening as external, silent observers, instead we are co-creating a peer-to-peer, iterative learning approach with partner institutions around the world to actively support the scaling process. During the three to four-year long lab process, we will routinely convene a diversity of stakeholders involved in the initiative(s) to identify scaling goals, develop and/or refine scaling action plans, and engage in a participatory and iterative process of implementing the scaling plan, reflecting on progress, and making course corrections along the way. The intention is to help strengthen capacity to scale among decision-makers through this participatory and applied research approach.\n",
      "In designing these Real-time Scaling Labs, we certainly didn’t start from scratch. We spent the past year researching a wide range of adaptive learning and collective impact approaches and considering how these methodologies might be applied to challenges around scaling in global education. One of the most useful approaches that we have drawn from is improvement science, a user-centered, problem-driven, iterative approach designed to accelerate learning-by-doing. Originally pioneered in the healthcare field by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, improvement science uses iterative cycles to rapidly test change ideas, and adjust based on data in a systemic rigorous way. I had the opportunity to attend the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching’s annual Summit on Improvement in Education earlier this month in San Francisco. At the conference, I heard about three key components of improvement science that really resonated with what we are trying to create with the scaling labs.\n",
      "1. Possibly incorrect and definitely incomplete\n",
      "Improvement science begins with the notion that the ideas we wish to test about how to improve education are possibly incorrect and definitely incomplete, and so will need to be reconsidered, adapted, and possibly even abandoned as we learn more. This notion is also at the core of the Real-time Scaling Labs, recognizing that scaling is not a linear process but is, in fact, cyclical, with ongoing challenges to overcome and opportunities to seize. We recognize that the first plan developed to scale an education intervention will most certainly not be the final one; it must change and be adapted throughout the process of scaling. Therefore, if we want to scale effectively and sustainably, we must continue to assess and adapt our strategies in response to ongoing changes that occur within any complex system, reacting to real-time learning rather than strictly adhering to our first assumptions. This underscores the importance of taking a flexible approach to designing, delivering, and financing interventions for scale. Part of this is also recognizing that setbacks will be an unavoidable and important part of the journey as they are critical moments to learn.\n",
      "2. Every system is perfectly designed to get the results that it gets\n",
      "Improvement science recognizes that we don’t exist in silos and vacuums. If we want to affect large-scale change, we must start by focusing on the broader system and understanding what in the system is producing the outcomes we currently see. Similarly, the scaling labs begin by convening a diverse group of stakeholders in-person to discuss and assess the nature of the problem the intervention(s) seeks to address and the system that produces it. By taking a systems approach, we are able to understand and address the processes and mechanisms within the system that are hindering the type of improvement we seek and to tackle the underlying causes behind the problems we are trying to solve. Additionally, by deliberately engaging a diverse composition of participants in the labs, we recognize the importance of getting multiple perspectives, as one person can only see part of the system.\n",

      "3. Control urges for solutionitis\n",
      "Before jumping to any conclusions about a potential solution, improvement science requires asking deeper questions about the data to truly understand the actual problem to be solved. An excellent speaker in one of the sessions I attended gave the example of the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials, which were decaying at an increasingly rapid rate. Evidence suggested it was a result of the cleaning process. Rather than rushing to make changes, improvement science led to asking why the monuments were cleaned so frequently and with such harsh chemicals. They found the frequent cleaning was to remove the large amount of bird droppings on the memorials. Why were so many birds flying over? Because of a large spider population on the memorials attracting the pigeons as food sources. And why so many spiders? Because of gnats swarming the monuments at dusk. And why so many gnats? They were drawn by the lighting of the monuments. This series of deep questions led to the decision to turn on the memorial lights one hour later, after sunset, eliminating the root cause of the problem (gnats). This will also be a core tenant of the scaling labs, as we will not be satisfied with identifying scaling challenges and opportunities to leverage at a surface level and jumping immediately to finding solutions, but rather will spend time to collectively understand the root causes and ensure our scaling plans seek to take those into account.\n",

      "What is a “smart” society? While flights of imagination from science-fiction writers, filmmakers, and techno-futurists involve things like flying cars and teleportation, in practice smart technology is making inroads in a piecemeal fashion, often in rather banal circumstances. In Chicago, for example, predictive analytics is improving health inspections schedules in restaurants, while in Boston city officials are collaborating with Waze, the traffic navigation app company, combining its data with inputs from street cameras and sensors to improve road conditions across the city. A city-state such as Singapore has a more holistic idea of a “smart nation,” where the vision includes initiatives from self-driving vehicles to cashless and contactless payments, robotics and assistive technologies, data-empowered urban environments, and technology-enabled homes.\n",

      "URL: Idea to retire: Viewing data as an output\n",
      "TITLE:\n",
      "It is rare to talk to federal administrators and not hear something about “data-driven decision making.” Administrators dedicate significant time and information technology resources to decisions about their agency’s viability and to defending their standing in appropriations discussions. However, the questions asked of the data by senior officials for these purposes are dramatically different than the questions asked by a front line case manager for a social service organization.  Unfortunately, it is the former that has the loudest voice in procurement and system design conversations.  The prevailing top-down approach to data collection and use also puts little actionable information in the hands of the people responsible for gathering data. As a result, the incentive to collect data is diminished while opportunities for informed program improvements and abilities to measure outcomes against costs are missed. A small shift in our approach to data collection and visualization could lead to big improvements in the effectiveness of social service delivery.\n",
      "While the effort to collect and analyze data gives the impression of transparency, we are actually looking at our institutions through a fun house mirror. Frameworks are geared toward only answering a small set of high-level questions, creating a false sense of openness that limits the policy discourse around those agencies to their funding—not their effectiveness. \n",
      "It is time for this “good on the surface” notion to die, and in its place we must re-orient our data collection strategies to inform our work as it happens. \n",
      "Make no mistake—for the vast majority of agencies this is a wholesale paradigm shift with significant implications for design, implementation, and evaluation of social service delivery.\n",
      "Collecting the wrong data\n",
      "Take the case of homelessness organizations. Social workers across the country bring homeless families into a network of wrap-around services available through several state and local agencies. With every meeting, they collect qualitative and quantitative data about clients and update the case management system that loosely connects to that network of providers. If effectively analyzed and visualized, this information would likely help spot warning signs of future trouble for the family and would give social workers a chance to make a meaningful early intervention.  Visualizing the data could also inform the network of providers of interventions that are working so they can put resources to the most effective programs.\n",
      "However, the data entered in the system is often not used to produce the types of insights needed to help best manage cases. Instead, the data is sent to analysts at The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) who, once a year, release large, static reports including the Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR), Annual Progress Report (APR), and HEARTH Performance Measures. HUD has strict guidelines and complex coding systems for how data can be entered, stored, and used by community service providers. The mandated once-yearly reports are the primary form of feedback case managers receive from the information they’ve entered and contain very little useful information for day-to-day client service. \n",
      "Where this backward looking systemic analysis is valued is among the policymakers making budgetary decisions. Forensic analysis of program effectiveness is usually measured along broad performance indicators like individuals served, cost-per-beneficiary, number of people who have exited from system dependence. But these reactive measures do very little to help social workers ensure that client families make progress and don’t slide back into poverty. Without that direct connection to their work, it is inevitable that data collection and analysis becomes an infrequent and low-value administrative task on top of an already large workload.\n",
      "Shifting mentalities\n",
      "As Andrew Means describes it, we need to “upgrade from an output mentality to an input plus output mentality” when it comes to using data in this context. Means, the founder of Data Analysts for Social Good and The Impact Lab, works with organizations to update data collection techniques and use data science to solve longstanding social problems. He argues that too many public institutions view data exclusively an output of a program to show whether or not the original design was effective. \n",

      "\n",
      "Instead, Means advocates for primarily viewing data as an input—information that establishes a baseline of understanding and makes predictive modeling possible alongside forensic analysis. He has seen how individuals who see a far greater value in the data are more likely collect data faithfully and accurately. Better data leads to better analysis helping inform programs, making more targeted, efficient, and effective program work is possible. \n",
      "Drawing on our previous example, using data as an input allows agencies to estimate which beneficiaries are most likely to drop out of a homeless support program or which program they would be best served by. This is clearly in an agency’s best interest. Not only is the agency able to focus human and financial resources where they are most effective, but overall improvements in outcomes will reflect positively in conventional budgetary discussions. \n",
      "Higher value data = better transparency\n",
      "This brings us back to the question of transparency and value. Data that is not valued is not rigorously collected or validated. Moreover, because the analysis is only interesting to a small group of administrators, reporting is an afterthought. That is why agencies often dump a 25 column, comma-delimited file with 10,000 rows of data on their website and assume they are meeting their disclosure obligations. This information is virtually inaccessible to the average person in that form. It exists to validate past decisions instead of informing future ones, and the by-product of that approach is a policy discourse that cannot leverage data to advance our service delivery beyond the status quo. \n",
      "For social workers, agency directors, and funders, the challenge is not to simply make the data available but to make it useful for everyone in the decision chain. By using contextual resources like data visualization, individuals are empowered to act and ask more, better questions of the data. For a social worker, this could be an opportunity to use data in their work with individuals or to coordinate with partners who provide additional services to clients. Further upstream, institutions have an opportunity to articulate their value, showcase their progress, and advocate for a broader understanding of issues critical to their work. \n",
      "Not only will this increase public understanding of key issues, but also increase the accountability of agencies and decision makers to their constituencies to the benefit of our broader society.\n",
      "By taking a grassroots approach to data system design, we can put analytical power back into the hands of the people who can most effectively use it for change. For example, the Community Technology Alliance partnered with our organization to put the HUD data discussed above into a series of interactive reports that will help homelessness agencies nationwide and give them an opportunity to combine that data with their proprietary data to draw out more valuable insights. Modeled as a nationwide Data Fellowship, the program trains a group of 20 homeless services data enthusiasts across the country on analytical tools and visualization best practices. In addition to building a first set of field-usable visualizations, the fellows will also train their peers on the value of collecting and using data in their work.\n",
      "This is not just an effort to tackle homelessness and create change within one social service organization’s reporting system. It is an effort to create a new standard for information utility and transparency that all organizations can follow based on a few simple principles:\n",
      "\n",
      "Data must be useful to those responsible for collecting it and acting on it.\n",
      "More useful data for local decision-makers means better data for federal and state funding agencies as well as taxpaying citizens\n",
      "Data and the story it tells must be accessible and easily understood at all levels\n",
      "\n",
      "This is our challenge to government information technology leaders—let the old output-only notion of data driven decision making die. Build systems from where the information is most valuable, easily understood, and actionable and let them yield better data. Encourage transparent institutions using better data, and enrich the public discussion about an agency’s value to society. \n",

      "If the biggest disrupter of the last few decades was Deng Xiaoping—the father of modern China—the big disrupter of the next few decades may well be John McCarthy. McCarthy, an American professor of Computer Science, is believed by many to be the father of artificial intelligence. Interestingly, the two have an epiphany in common. In 1979, Deng, a lifelong communist, visited the United States and came back a believer in market capitalism. In 1968, after a two-day visit to Czechoslovakia, McCarthy, who was raised as a communist by his immigrant parents, became a free-market Republican.\n",
      "The ideas of computer scientists and mathematicians like McCarthy are radically transforming the way we communicate, and the way we make, buy, and sell goods and services. The changes will likely be so great that societies will have to reorganize government policy—rethinking how to regulate, what to subsidize, and whom to tax.\t\n",

      "Change comes to Europe, again\n",
      "Nowhere are these changes being considered more seriously than in Europe, where the technological transformations collectively called “Industry 4.0” are not unprecedented. At the end of the 19th century, as the Second Industrial Revolution unfolded in Western Europe, it brought mass unemployment in the countryside and squalor in the cities. Machines replaced peasants, who fled to cities and became the new urban poor. As they found new employment, mostly in the urban industrial sector, they joined a growing middle class. They would eventually transform Europe into a continent with the highest standards of living in the world.\n",
      "A century later, Industry 4.0 technologies again threaten to replace their descendants with machines. But this time, Europe is a very different place. Europeans have changed from colonizers to traders, and the European Union replaced a clutch of warring nations. So even though technological change has precedent, it brings unprecedented imperatives. The European economic model puts a premium on social solidarity, and the European Union on political integration. Finding a way to remain competitive while juggling these social and political objectives has not been easy. Now Europe faces new questions. Will the new wave of digital technologies make this balancing act easier or impossible? Are Europeans better equipped than Asians and Americans to manage the trade-offs, or are these technologies coming when Europe is least prepared for them?  \n",
      "In Europe 4.0, a World Bank research and policy project that we started earlier this year, we hope to answer these questions. Based on the work that we’ve completed, Europe’s workers, consumers, businesses, and policymakers will have to learn a new alphabet that will allow them to cohabit with these technologies. The ABC of the new world is Algorithms, Big data, and the Computer chip.\n",
      "All technologies are not created equal\n",
      "Today, there are more bits of data on Earth than grains of sand. Even though less than 1 percent of available data is actually being used, the leading companies are all data (or “tech”) companies. This is new. In 2000, there were three tech companies among the top 10 most valuable companies in the world. Today, the top seven are all tech companies: Five are American, two Chinese, none are European.\n",
      "“So what?” you might ask. For one, it means that Europe is missing out on big profits. Data companies have significantly higher operating margins than traditional companies—20 percent higher, by one estimate. Higher profit margins inevitably mean bigger market shares. Europe risks being locked out of this new economy. With that will come a decline in economic power, and declining global influence. Most Europeans will not take this well. Nor should they.\n",

      "Like most things in economics, the drivers of this new data economy are costs. A closer look reveals that the new technologies are cutting three types of costs. The first is the cost of computing which has fallen so dramatically that almost everyone in Europe now has an affordable supercomputer in their pockets. The second is the decline in the cost of matching demand and supply through low-cost transaction platforms, such as Uber and Airbnb, or Fintech innovations like Kenya’s MPESA. The third is the cost of substituting workers with (much less fussy) robots. Robots are already common in parts of manufacturing such as automobiles, and becoming ever more ubiquitous in logistics and transportation.\n",
      "Europe 4.0 organizes these technologies into three types (Figure 1):\n",
      "\n",
      "Informational technologies that exploit the exponential growth of data. Examples include the internet of things, big data analytics, and cloud computing. The fundamental driver is the falling cost of computing. The main effect is to lower coordination costs.\n",
      "Transactional technologies that digitize business models. Examples include the sharing economy, gig economy, digital platforms, and blockchain. The fundamental driver is the falling cost of matching demand and supply. The main effect is to reduce information asymmetries.\n",
      "Operational technologies that combine data with automation. Examples include robotics, 3D printing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. The fundamental driver is the falling cost of routine functions. The main effect is to reduce labor costs by automating activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 1: Industry 4.0 technologies\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not clear whether these technologies will lead to greater concentration of production in leading regions or countries, or in larger enterprises that use more capital-intensive forms of production. For Europe, it matters a lot whether they do.\n",
      "A simple framework for Europe (and other places)\n",
      "At present, Europe has a moderately strong presence in informational and operational technologies, but it is lagging in transactional technologies. Figure 2 summarizes our working hypotheses regarding the effects of Industry 4.0 technologies on Europe’s objectives of economic competitiveness, social inclusion, and political integration. Policies to encourage the adoption of informational technologies are likely to help with all three policy goals. Adopting new transactional technologies such as digital platforms will aid competitiveness and possibly help with social inclusion, but will likely lead to economic concentration in leading countries and regions. Operational technologies may be even more socially and spatially polarizing.  \n",
      "Figure 2: Industry 4.0 technologies and Europe’s policy objectives\n",
      "\n",
      "Industry 4.0 technologies are likely to be viewed quite differently in developing countries that care mostly about economic competitiveness (think China) compared with advanced economies like the United States where economic competitiveness and social inclusion are both important policy objectives. Spare a thought for the European Union, which must juggle the three objectives all at once.\n",

      "路透北京6月24日 - 新冠肺炎疫情对中国银行业的冲击不仅表现在资产质量显著承压，同时也延缓了其不良资产的处置进程。 \n",
      "零售板块不良压力已经显现，而对公不良方面，虽然延期还本付息进一步延长等政策令其暂获喘息，但业内普遍预计，明年一季度后对公不良或大量涌现，加紧处置当期不良以为未来留有空间，是多数银行必然之选。 \n",
      "路透获悉，中国银保监会已窗口指导部分商业银行加快不良资产处置力度，同时部分地方监管机构亦发文要求不良率及余额维持在合理区间。但考虑到今年以来不良市场供过于求且疫情严重影响了相关机构尽调、司法拍卖等环节进展，不良处置进度料低于预期。 \n",
      "“监管部门要求我们加大处置不良的力度，确保坐实利润、坐实资产质量，”一上市银行相关部门负责人对路透称，”我们现在也做好了计划安排，要多投入财务资源、利润做好准备，如果（不良）发生多了要及时处理。”     \n",
      "近日四川省金融局、银保监局等多部门联合印发支持金融机构加快不良资产处置的措施，对辖内金融机构不良资产进行清单式管理，确保属地不良资产余额和不良资产率保持在合理区间；通过现金清收、重组、核销、打包转让、资产证券化等多种方式，加大不良资产化解处置力度。 \n",
      "“加强对金融机构不良资产化解工作的考核，督促各银行机构尤其是高风险银行机构切实做好不良资产压降，化解存量、严控新增，防止不良资产’边清边冒’，”上述文件要求。 \n",
      "同时，近日北京金融局等多部门亦公布《外资资管机构北京发展指南》，将探索以符合条件的交易场所为平台，在北京开展银行不良资产跨境转让业务试点。 \n",
      "银保监会上月末表示，目前银行业不良贷款保持高位运行，潜在风险较大；今年要持续加大不良资产处置力度，提高资产分类准确性。今年一季度，商业银行处置不良贷款4,055亿元人民币，同比多处置726亿元。 \n",
      "中国央行研究局课题组此前亦撰文称，随着实体经济困难向金融领域传导的滞后效应逐渐显现，银行后期不良贷款处置和资本消耗压力明显加大，银行利润增速可能下滑，不排除年内出现零增长或负增长的可能。银行有必要做好预案，应对可能出现的不良贷款反弹。 \n",
      "**对公不良压力料明年显现** \n",
      "业内人士指出，与以往年度不同，当前资产质量下行压力主要体现在零售板块，因疫情导致居民收入下降、失业率上升，影响个人信贷资产质量；而对公不良或将于明年一季度后暴露，但也取决于疫情持续时间及可控程度。 \n",
      "“现在个贷的不良首先爆发，包括个人经营贷、信用卡等，...对公贷款方面，因为有延期还本付息等政策，我们预计（明年）一季度后会有很大的量出来。”一股份行相关部门负责人称。 \n",
      "中国5月下旬公布的今年政府工作报告明确，强化对稳企业的金融支持，中小微企业贷款延期还本付息政策再延长至明年3月底，对普惠型小微企业贷款应延尽延，对其他困难企业贷款协商延期。 \n",
      "前述上市银行人士亦指出，延期还本付息等政策缓解了企业的经营和财务压力，但延迟还息不是免息也非减息，明年3月末政策到期后，若企业因疫情持续仍未完全恢复生产经营，届时财务压力恐有增无减。 \n",
      "“真正到明年3月份能够把前面的利息都付了，还能活下去的企业，我觉得不多，”他称，也要时刻关注疫情发展形势，如果能够控制住，企业的经营压力会有所减轻。 \n",

      "“在中国市场卖空的效率太差。要么就没有可供借入的股票，要么耗费太长时间，”Yuan说。他为浙江玉皇山南投资管理有限公司管理一支全球宏观基金。 \n",
      "浑水(Muddy Waters)的Carson Block和Wolfpack Research的Dan David以做空中资股票而闻名，但和Yuan一样，他们的押注也仅限于纽约或香港市场，而不包括上海或深圳。 \n",
      "这种局面可能即将改变。上周五，监管机构放松对国内市场人士在深圳创业板市场转融券的规定，并在考虑允许外国人借入或借出大陆市场股票用于作空。 \n",
      "这一改革可望增强竞争力，让中国市场缩小与纽约和东京等融资中心的差距。 \n",
      "官方数据显示，截至6月16日，上海和深圳股市借券沽空规模总计39.6亿美元，相比8.9万亿美元的市值，比率为0.044%。 \n",
      "尽管各个市场计算空仓数据的方式不尽相同，但IHS Markit数据显示，美国股市空单余额为7,800亿美元，占市值的2.4%，日本股市为1.5%。 \n",
      "但经纪商TF Securities估计，改革或促使中国股市今年做空规模可能增长10倍，明年则会翻一番。 \n",
      "其他人则指出了无数的障碍—包括运营层面的和文化层面的。 \n",
      "“短期而言，许多障碍都是难以逾越的，”对冲基金Full Harvest执行长、贝莱德(Blackrock)前基金经理Wang Li表示。”这么多年过去了，变化不大，因此我不抱什么希望。” \n",
      "**实质改革** \n",
      "周五的调整标志着2015年以来的一项重大转变，当时投资者指责”恶意”做空者非法”操纵”期货市场，触发崩盘。 \n",
      "渴望吸引国际资金的监管方称，他们更能够接受长期投资者将做空作为对冲工具，以及通过做空被认为估值过高的股票来获利。 \n",
      "监管方还希望，如果做空者的看空有助于限制投机性泡沫，可能将成为稳定市场的力量。 \n",
      "对创业板的调整可能从8月起生效，这是对该板上市体系改革的部分措施。 \n",
      "根据这些改革，更大范围的国内市场参与者，包括战略投资者、共同基金、退休基金和保险商在内，将获准出借股票。 \n",
      "创业板投资者将能够在股票上市后即做空，而主板有三个月的延期。 \n",

      "“我乐观看待今年会有更多进展”，亚洲证券业与金融市场协会(ASIFMA)股市和交易后事务主管Lyndon Chao表示。 ASIFMA代表了在亚洲的全球资产管理公司和经纪商，其定期与内地官员讨论市场问题。 \n",
      "那些寻求对冲内地曝险的外资，目前只能作空股指期货。这些外资在其他地方通常能参与作空股票。 \n",
      "**摩擦** \n",
      "市场人士虽然乐见改革，但他们表示，实施起来可不容易。一个问题就是要找到出借的股票。 \n",
      "Full Harvest的Wang表示，”许多中国机构频繁交易以迅速获利，因此不太可能出借股票。” \n",
      "另一个问题在于集中式体系的成本。设计该体系的目的是确保政府监管。 \n",
      "“让中证金融公司(CSF)扮演中间人的角色，就会增加摩擦。他们还会额外收取两个百分点的费用，”对冲基金公司鸣石投资的副总经理Fang Ming说。 \n",
      "Fang和其他人表示，允许市场参与者自行确定条款将有助于、但不会解决多出一个中间人所导致的问题。 \n",
      "根据券商数据和市场消息人士，借入大陆上市股票的年度成本超过股票价值的8%，而香港仅为0.9-1.2%。 \n",
      "**终极测试** \n",
      "近来对于卖空机构公开指出企业潜在问题的支持声音有所增强，因为之前曝出多宗企业会计丑闻，包括美国上市的中资咖啡连锁企业—瑞幸咖啡(LK.O)在4月称，公司高管对去年营收数字造假。 \n",
      "在瑞幸坦承的两个月前，浑水发布的一篇匿名报告便已质疑瑞幸的业绩增长。 \n",
      "浙江玉皇山南投资公司的Yuan表示，更开放的沽空机制有助于淘汰有问题的公司。 \n",
      "“需要沽空者打下这些公司，然后踢出去。否则它们会伤害投资者。” \n",
      "中国监管机关誓言对上市公司的诈欺行为”零容忍”。对于当局接受沽空行为的新态度而言，最大考验在于监管机构是否会让沽空者发动攻击，而不是像2015年那样处罚沽空。 \n",
      "“我可能会写文章批评一些上市公司，可是要非常小心，措辞一定要婉转，”上海高级金融学院教授Xin Chen最近在一场视频研讨会中对风险投资者表示。 \n",

      "共和党治理的州，尤其是南部多州，在疫情初期采取抗疫措施时动作迟疑，而放松限制措施的步伐倒比较快。这些州现在新冠病例出现创纪录增长，纽约州等一些州特别针对这些州的居民采取隔离措施。纽约州在危机初期受到的冲击最为严重，但在控制疫情方面取得的进展最大。 \n",

      "路透北京6月28日 - 继中国工业增加值连续两月正增长，5月工业企业利润同比亦由负转正，为去年12月以来首次，这主要归功于降成本措施显效，工业生产者出厂价格降幅小于购进价格等因素，石油加工等重点行业明显改善亦拉动整体利润回升，工业企业利润延续修复走势。 \n",
      "不过分析人士亦指出，鉴于国内外需求复苏仍有不确定性，5月指标显示工业销售增速有所放缓，利润回升的可持续性仍待观察。     \n",
      "中国国家统计局周日公布，5月规模以上工业企业实现利润总额5,823.4亿元人民币，同比增长6.0%，逆转去年12月以来的跌势；1-5月利润总额18,434.9亿元，同比下降19.3%，降幅比前四月收窄8.1个百分点。 \n",
      "“国内工业企业部门经营状况延续修复性反弹走势，从趋势看，工业部门利润有望保持低速扩张格局。”光大银行金融市场部分析师周茂华称。 \n",
      "他称，从国内看，需求处于修复改善轨道，一系列降成本让利、稳投资、激活民间经济政策效果逐步释放；从海外看，能源商品价格维持低位，复工复产有望继续推进，均有助于改善国内工业制造业部门经营环境。  \n",
      "但全球疫情防控与经济形势仍严峻，国内通过财政货币政策降低企业负担，提供必要资金周转支持，释放、挖掘国内巨大需求潜力的同时，亦需积极引导企业以国内需求导向转型升级，推动国内投资、消费、就业形成良性循环。 \n",
      "国家统计局工业司高级统计师朱虹表示，5月份，随着复工复产深入推进，生产经营秩序逐步恢复，工业企业效益状况持续改善，当月利润增速实现由负转正。但累计看，1-5月份利润同比降幅依然较大。 \n",
      "“尽管5月份工业企业利润实现今年以来首次增长，但疫情影响下市场需求依然偏弱，利润回升的持续性还需进一步观察。”朱虹称，下阶段仍要积极贯彻落实各项援企助企政策，稳住经济基本盘，促进工业经济回升向好。 \n",
      "利润回升持续性待察主要表现在，一是工业销售增速有所放缓，5月规上工业企业营业收入增速比4月回落3.7个百分点；二是利润转好行业数量有所减少，在41个工业大类行业中有21个行业利润增速比上月加快或降幅收窄，比4月份减少12个行业。 \n",
      "统计局数据显示，前五月规模以上工业企业实现营业收入36.88万亿元，同比下降7.4%（前四月-9.9%）；发生营业成本31.26万亿元，下降6.8%（前值-9.1%）；营业收入利润率为5.00%，同比降低0.74个百分点（前值4.45%）。 \n",
      "民银智库研究员张雨陶认为，5月工业企业利润实现2020年以来首次正增长，但预计未来利润难以持续显着回升。 \n",
      "主要原因在于，供给端修复接近尾声，工业生产回升力度有所减弱，5月工业增加值同比增速升幅较上月收窄，工业销售增速也有所放缓；而且海外疫情风险尚未解除，叠加国内疫情有所反复，致使外需和内需不足开始同时凸显，出口和消费恐将拖累工业生产；此外，PPI持续通缩，工业企业下游需求有所恢复但依然偏弱，企业长期盈利空间依然承压。 \n",
      "**石油加工等利润改善**         \n",
      "从分项指标看，朱虹指出，工业企业效益状况继续改善。5月营业收入利润率为6.82%，同比提高0.29个百分点，5月末工业企业亏损面比4月末下降2.7个百分点，产成品存货增速比4月末回落1.6个百分点，显示企业亏损状况有所好转，库存压力有所缓解。 \n",

      "文章还引述具体数据指出，隔夜和七天回购利率在4月底均出现近10年最低值，而3月银行间市场杠杆水平回升至110%的近年来高位，M2（广义货币）增速与M1（狭义货币）增速的剪刀差从2月的4%持续上升至4月的5.6%，资金空转和金融风险苗头已经出现。 \n",

      "路透澳洲朗塞斯顿6月22日 - 对于那些期待中国在新冠疫情过后将出现V型经济复苏的人而言，许多主要金属的价格及需求回升是一个令人振奋的迹象。 \n",
      "而从螺纹钢到铁矿石、铜、铝和锌等许多金属的中国库存下滑，更进一步支持认为景气迅速反弹的观点。 \n",
      "这些金属最近几周价格强劲上涨并非巧合。 \n",
      "值得进一步注意的是，价格表现落后于其它金属的镍，其库存最近几周也在增加。 \n",
      "当然库存水平并非影响金属价格的唯一因素，但在中国一直是可靠的价格趋势指标，就算将平常的季节性库存增减纳入考量也是如此。 \n",
      "上海期铜上周收于每吨47,320元人民币(6,684美元)，为2月初以来最高。这比3月23日创下的年内收盘低点高出约29.4%；当时正处于中国政府为遏制新冠病毒传播而采取严格封锁措施期间。 \n",
      "截至6月19日当周，上海期货交易所铜库存减少14.2%至109,969吨，为2019年1月以来最低水平。 \n",
      "与截至3月13日当周达到的380,085吨的今年峰值相比，铜库存下降了71%左右。 \n",
      "鉴于2020年前5个月未锻造铜进口实际上比去年同期增长12.4%，而铜矿石和精矿的进口增长了2.2%，库存下降确实表明需求强劲。 \n",
      "上海三个月期铝上周收于每吨13,390元，比4月2日所及年内低点上涨17.9%，但仍比去年年底价位低4.6%。 \n",
      "随着价格上涨，上海铝库存稳步下降，从3月20日止当周的533,994吨降至上周的238,703吨，触及五个月最低水平。 \n",
      "**铁矿石、钢** \n",
      "据咨询机构钢之家的数据，6月19日止当周，铁矿石库存为1.0835亿吨，较前一周的1.0775亿吨略微上升，前一周的库存水平为2016年10月以来低点。 \n",
      "大连期交所的铁矿石合约上周收报每吨770.5元，较6月8日触及的年内高点777.5元略有下滑，但较去年年底已经上涨34%。 \n",
      "螺纹钢期货上周收报每吨3,629元，较2月初触及的年内低点上涨16.5%。螺纹钢价格上涨的同时，其库存从3月13日日止当周的1,300万吨降至上周的715万吨，为四个月最低水平。 \n",
      "上海期锌上周涨至每吨16,745元人民币，较3月19日低点上涨了15.4%，与此同时，上海的锌库存降至96,796吨。这比今年3月13日当周触及的高位169,911吨减少43%。 \n",
      "模式很清晰：中国金属库存下降伴随着金属价格的上涨。库存基本持稳或者甚至上涨的地方，金属价格也表现平稳。 \n",
      "上海的镍库存持稳，上周实际增加了2.8%至28,365吨，而镍价则有所下滑。 \n",
      "上海期镍上周收报每吨103,410元人民币，较4月2日低点上涨了13.3%。然而，镍价自4月底以来一直守在相对狭窄的区间内，反映了库存水平的波动较为温和。 \n",
      "虽然中国和全球其它地区的经济能否从疫情中强劲复苏，仍存在一些疑点，但目前中国的许多关键金属库存下滑，暗示金属价格将继续表现坚韧。(完) \n",

      "BODY: (本文作者Mike Dolan为路透新闻金融及市场特约编辑，以下内容仅代表其个人观点) \n",
      "路透伦敦6月19日 - 就像新型冠状病毒一样，疫情期间通胀的一大问题就是我们几乎对它一无所知，这样的信息落差迫使各地央行立即采取行动，之后再来找答案。 \n",
      "通胀长期低迷的情形下，新冠病毒危机会对通胀产生何种影响，经济学家和投资人看法分歧。 \n",
      "尽管多数人认为病毒所引发的封锁措施及景气衰退将会带来通缩压力，有一些人仍然担心大规模的货币及财政反应，加上全球化进程开倒车，恐将最终重新触发物价上涨。 \n",
      "不过现在就此选定立场，有很大程度是基于个人想法，缺乏事实佐证。 \n",
      "尽管官方的整体通胀数据显示通胀下滑，这一点无庸置疑，但是数据内容相当混乱，因为许多商店、酒吧、餐厅、戏院都还在停业当中，从而产生信息落差，另外，不再能够反映消费者行为的一篮子物价也有诸多问题。 \n",
      "哈佛教授Alberto Cavallo根据防疫封锁期间的借记卡和信用卡交易数据，开发出了另一种消费者物价权重—“另类新冠篮子”。  \n",
      "他上月的论文显示，消费者在价格上涨的食品和日用品方面的支出相对要高得多；而在价格下降的交通、酒店和娱乐方面的支出减少。 \n",
      "自从新冠疫情爆发以来，多数官方统计机构还没有更新这些数据。 \n",
      "Cavallo得出的结论是，美国、以及所研究的另外16个国家中的10个，4月的整体通胀率和核心通胀率均高于公布数值。 \n",
      "美国4月整体”新冠篮子”物价较上年同期上升1.06%，美国劳工统计局公布的数值为0.35%。 \n",
      "“这种差异是相当大的，而且随着时间的推移而不断增加，”Cavallo写道，并补充称，在考察核心通胀时也出现了类似的情况，表明这不仅仅是食品和能源价格影响的结果。 \n",
      "他的论文说，无法获得或处于”缺货”状态的商品价格—通常只是被官方指标排除在外—明显上涨。由于严重依赖送货上门，许多在线平台上的商品价格都高于实体店。 \n",
      "Cavallo说，这些结果表明实际或经通胀调整后的消费受到的冲击要大于官方数据所显示的程度，因此对政策制定者具有重要意义。 \n",
      "由于低收入人群将较高比例的闲钱用于食品和生活必需品，而不是休闲活动，因此对他们的打击也会更大。 \n",
      "明显需要注意的是，这种效应并不普遍，并且可能是相反的影响。德国、英国和意大利是”COVID篮子”通胀率低于官方数据的六个国家之一，可能部分是因为较早解除封锁使供应瓶颈得到缓解。 \n",
      "另一个需要注意的是，任何与疫情相关的扭曲都是暂时的，决策者应努力看清这一点。 \n",
      "美国道富银行本周表示，Cavallo的模型表明，通缩风险似乎”比实际更虚幻，而’真实的’通胀率可能比报导得要高。”   \n",
      "tmsnrt.rs/2YfY5Nb \n",
      "**通缩占上风？** \n",
      "至少迄今为止，多数货币政策决策者都在对众多通缩信号做出反应—担心眼下的整体物价下降会逐步影响到通胀预期。 \n",
      "随着公共和民间债务水平不断攀升，整个经济出现持续通缩的前景令人不安，因为假以时日这将提高偿还债务的实际成本。 \n",
      "而且自Cavallo的研究以来，美国和欧元区5月主要通胀率均进一步下滑至只有0.1%。英国通胀率降至四年低点仅有0.5%。 \n",
      "由于货币宽松政策仍在全面实施，央行官员们非常清楚自己的立场。 \n",
      "美联储副主席克拉里达(Richard Clarida)周二表示，通胀预期有可能降至美联储2%目标以下。 \n",
      "在疫情大流行刚开始蔓延时便已经跌至1%以下，金融市场长期通胀预期在美国国内仍低于1.6%，在欧元区也仅仅徘徊在1%略上方。 \n",
      "许多央行虽然意识到存在短期失真，但认为封锁带来的行为变化，可能只会催生令人困惑的长期通缩趋势。 \n",
      "英国央行货币政策委员会(MPC)委员邓雷罗(Silvana Tenreyro)上月表示，封锁造成的失真使得通胀数据”尤其难以”解读，但情况可能是事先看到的物价下行压力在封锁之后被放大。 \n",
      "她表示，令人困惑的是，近年来走强的工资增长和单位劳动成本为何没有推高核心通胀率，一种可能说得通的解释是，在通胀篮子中所占权重较高的行业的薪资涨幅要小得多。 \n",
      "邓雷罗还表示，商业租金等固定投入成本的下降，帮助抵消了劳动力成本的上升。 \n",
      "“这似乎有可能加速这些变化，”她在谈到疫情时表示，并举出如下事实，更快地转向网购的趋势影响实体店工资，更多人居家办公则影响商业租金。(完) \n",

      "BODY:路透北京6月29日 - 中国一位学者撰文称，央行货币宽松政策”适时退出”并不意味着”急踩刹车”收紧货币，而是为了”退空转”，更好服务实体经济，避免刺激政策的后遗症为未来的发展留下隐患。 \n",
      "署名为余初心的该学者在中国媒体第一财经上撰文表示，针对突发事件推出的特殊政策有其阶段性，不可能长期持续存在，必然存在适时退出的一刻；投资者应专业判断，既要避免投机心理，又要对”退空转”政策的影响提前应对。 \n",
      "文章并指出，4月份以来，伴随国内疫情防控形势持续向好，经济数据呈现好转态势。同时，个别金融领域出现杠杆率回升和资金空转现象，金融风险苗头隐现。 \n",
      "“随着形势逐步向好的方向转变，刺激政策的力度是否需要提前做好调整，避免相关后遗症影响今后经济稳定运行成为重要考虑。”文章表示。 \n",
      "其认为，央行根据经济金融形势的变化，灵活调整了政策操作，积极防范金融风险并提前考虑政策工具适时退出，其目的是为经济金融长期持续稳定健康运行夯实基础。 \n",
      "从近期的市场调整看，存款类机构七天期质押回购加权利率（DR007）回归至接近2.20%的政策利率水平，一级市场发行回暖，券商短融本月发行规模同比上升1.7倍，同业存单发行连续两周环比回升。金融市场流动性合理充裕的局面并未发生逆转，结构上还有优化的趋势。 \n",
      "文章认为，由此可以看出，近期的金融市场调整，针对的是刺激政策实施后难以完全避免的套利甚至资金空转行为，政策目的是为了及时遏制泡沫膨胀，引导资金流向实体企业，避免刺激政策的后遗症为未来的发展留下隐患。 \n",
      "文章还引述具体数据指出，隔夜和七天回购利率在4月底均出现近10年最低值，而3月银行间市场杠杆水平回升至110%的近年来高位，M2（广义货币）增速与M1（狭义货币）增速的剪刀差从2月的4%持续上升至4月的5.6%，资金空转和金融风险苗头已经出现。 \n",
      "此外，央行数据亦显示，今年以来结构性存款规模已连续四个月环比增长并创出新高。截至4月末，结构性存款总规模已达12.14万亿元人民币，较去年末增约26.48%。其中，单位结构性存款规模从去年底的5.42万亿升至7.43万亿，贡献了今年以来的绝大部分增量。 \n",
      "**特殊政策必然有退出的一刻** \n",
      "文章称，站在市场观察者的角度看，市场机构还是需要正确认识特殊政策的阶段性特征，秉承理性投资、价值投资、长期投资的理念，不能靠短期投机一条路走到黑。央行也应该在防范金融风险的基础上，加强与市场的沟通，稳定市场预期。 \n",
      "应对突发公共卫生事件，货币政策出手早见效快，稳定了市场信心，降低了社会融资成本，在保主体、稳就业方面发挥重要作用。但宏观政策的制定和实施，必然是在全面汇总相关信息基础上统筹考量的结果 \n",
